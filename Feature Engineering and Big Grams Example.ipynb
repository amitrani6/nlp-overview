    "# Feature Engineering and Big Grams Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains examples of NLP feature engineering, specifically Big Grams; the combination of words as features or dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bigrams** are every pair of words in the corpus; some pairs of words that appear at least a minimum of times (usually five) hold more information than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sentence 'I live in Santa Ana.' has the bigrams: (I, live); (live, in); (in, Santa); and (Santa, Ana). The bigram (Santa, Ana) will carry more information than (in, Santa) because it conveys the name of a place rather than a random pairing of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ngrams** can be groups of n number of words or characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can rank any of these groups with a metric known as **Pointwise Mutual Information Score**, a statistical measure of dependency between the items within a group. The higher the score, the more information that the group conveys."
