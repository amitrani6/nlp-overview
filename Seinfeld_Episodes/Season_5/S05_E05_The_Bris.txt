They'reprobably creating a whole army of pig warriors.GeorgeI wish there were pigmen. You get a few of these pigmen walkingaround I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants tofix me up at least they could say, "Hey he's no pig-man!"JerryBelieve me, there'd be plenty of women going for the pig-men. Nomatter what the deformity you'll find some group of pervertsattracted to it.

Patients, doctors, everyone, just griefstricken over this unfortunate occurrence.GeorgeWell, I join them in their grief.Mrs. SweedlerHorrible, just a horrible thing. Flew right past the children'swing. All the sick children, in the playroom, looking out thewindow, just traumatize by the incident. Apparently, they allthought he was flying. You know how children are, "Oh look. A manis flying. A man is flying" And then, splat...GeorgeYes, splat. Exactly. Splat. That's where I come in. On splat. Yousee, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?Mrs. SweedlerMrs. Sweedler's fine.GeorgeYou see, that trudge affected me in a very, very personal way.Mrs. SWEEDLERHow is that?GeorgeYes, you see, the deceased landed on my car. The splat, as itwere, actually took place on the roof of my car. I can't help butthink that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy may havebeen averted but I've never been the type to buy a convertible,what with the baldness and all.Mrs. SWEEDLERWell I've known bald men who owned convertibles. They wore a hat.GeorgeWell then it's all pulled down. Anyway. The damage,unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, renderingit virtually undriveable.Mrs. SWEEDLER(STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is a shame.GeorgeYes, a shame. That's just how I would describe it. Now, with alldue sensitivity and discretion, bearing in mind the scope of thesituation, I can't help but think the hospital bears someresponsibility to compensate the other, still living "victim", ofthis horrendous, horrendous tragedy.SHE GLARESMrs.SweedlerMr.Constanza.GeorgeYes.Mrs. SWEEDLERA man plummeted tragically to his ultimate demise -GeorgeYes.Mrs. SWEEDLER... and you greedily, callously try to profit from it.George(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET)Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimates that I'm notreally profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..Mrs. SWEEDLER(WITH ANGER) How dare you.GEORGEWhat?Mrs. SWEEDLERHave you no decency? Have you no shame?GeorgeYes.. you know, depending.Mrs. SWEEDLERGet out!
