So Loretta was swearing at you and yelling at you? Yeah.
And she really thought you were cheating on her? Auntie Rae gave me she gave me the finger - as she was driving away.
Yeah.
- Did she really? - Oh God.
- " you, Larry.
" How's it feel living alone? Well, I'm not alone.
I've still got Leon.
Umm, listen.
I know I brought it up a million times, but NBC is still harping me about about doing a "Seinfeld" reunion.
Again? Don't they give up, these people? So what do you think? You know, those reunion shows, they're so lame, really.
They never work.
The actors are 10 years older.
It just doesn't look right.
You know, I don't think so.
Jerry would never want to do it, either.
All right, look.
I'm in agreement with you but here's what I need, okay? Come with me to NBC let me set up a meeting say no.
That way I can always say to them, "He said no.
You heard it from him.
" - Fine.
- Thank you.
They'll leave me alone.
We move on to other things.
None of this crap.
- Hi, honey.
How are you doing? - Hi.
Oh, the same.
- I'm sorry.
- Really not good.
Hi, Lar.
- Hey.
What's the matter? - L you know, I'm tired.
I'm achy my knees ache.
I feel weak.
I've been to two doctors everybody says I'm fine, It's in my head which is bullshit.
As you know, I'm always happy and up.
You are a picture of happiness.
- She does have a very good disposition.
- She's bubbly.
- Wouldn't you say that? Bubbly.
- Yeah, I think so.
I've never been so tired.
It's just like Have you been in any tall grass lately? Well, you know, on Fire Island I was in tall grass.
I was on the dunes, in the grass when we were there.
Have you been tested for Lyme disease? You think it's a tick bite or something? It could be.
I know somebody who had something, it wasn't diagnosed and then it turned out to be Lyme disease.
What have you got to lose? Take a blood test.
What are you, a ing doctor? How do you know these things? I'm a hypochondriac, so I'm aware of this stuff.
Oh my God.
- What is this? - What are you doing? I can't believe it.
This is the second time I've run into you in, what, three weeks.
- What are you doing here? - I had an audition.
- Really? - Yeah, I'm acting again.
- Wow.
How'd you do? - I did okay.
- Yeah.
- I don't think I got it.
I don't know.
How do you know? What are you doing here? I have a meeting with Jeff and NBC about a "Seinfeld" reunion, - but it's - Really? Yeah, but I'm not I'm not gonna do it.
I'm just going No, that's perfect.
People love reunion shows.
How much would people love to see that cast back together? See what they're doing now, years later, and how they look? - So you'd be running running it.
- Yeah, I'd be writing it.
- Yeah, what I used to do.
Yeah.
- Writing it and my God.
You have to write a part for me.
- Oh ho, you've got it.
- Okay.
I'm not kidding.
- Yeah.
- I'm not kidding.
- You're not kidding.
Okay, fine.
- No, I'm not.
- What else is going on? - Oh, I'm just I'm doing Pilates, I'm learning Japanese and I'm into the Lakers.
- I am finally appreciating - Now you're into basketball? - After I leave? - But I've got some girlfriends that are they are into it and we're going on Thursday night, - going to the game.
- Really? I was actually thinking about going to that game.
I was gonna buy scalper's tickets.
- Oh.
- Maybe I'll run into you.
- I'm sure you will.
Why wouldn't you? - Why wouldn't I? Yeah.
- I should run.
- Okay.
- But it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.
- Really.
Bye.
- Bye.
- What's she doing here? - She's she's acting again.
- She had an audition.
- Oh.
Good for her.
- All right, let's get this bullshit over with.
- Okay.
Larry, I'm going to ask you the same question that every affiliate asks me every day of my job is "When are we going to get a 'Seinfeld' reunion?" - Mm-hmm.
- Huh? - Yeah.
I don't know.
- Huh? Well, the window is wide open right now and it's kind of perfect.
- Well, listening to you - Mm-hmm.
has me excited.
- Well, it's because I'm excited! I think that what are you thinking? Hour, half hour? I am thinking whatever you want to do.
What are you thinking? Do you want to do an hour? Do you want to do a half hour? We don't care.
It's the finest commodity NBC has put out I really like what you did in that take.
Really? 'Cause I can try it a different way if you want me to.
- I can - No, don't change a thing.
It's perfect.
And as far as the rest of you go, I've got a couple of little things.
- Uh, Michael? - Yeah.
I loved the entrance.
That slide? It's working.
Well, it's making me a bit dizzy, but I'll do anything for you, Larry.
Julia, the business with the apple come on, how funny is that? Hey, it was your idea and it completely works.
The glasses? You're killing me.
I can't do it as good as you, but I'm gonna keep trying.
Yeah, and that new line the kumquat and the quail? - You're amazing.
- Yeah, amazing.
- Amazing.
- Yeah, you're really unbelievable, Larry.
We are thinking to leave the door open to the creative - I'll I'll do it.
- What? - I'll do it.
- You'll do it?! - That is amazing.
- Really? - That's fantastic.
- Wow.
- You're gonna do it? - I'm gonna do it.
And I have a pretty good idea for George too.
- He's already writing.
- In the 11 years since the show's been off the air, he's gotten married, divorced and now he's gonna try to get his wife back.
- Funny.
- Okay.
I know it's not a great idea, but I can work on it.
- No, I think it's a great idea.
- I love this.
- What about Jerry? - I'll talk to Jerry and I'll talk to the cast.
- Great.
Great.
- Great.
- Awesome.
- We need to celebrate.
- We do, yes.
- You like basketball? - Of course.
- Do I like basketball? Yeah, of course.
- He loves basketball.
- Do you want to go to a Laker's game? We were gonna try to go Thursday night.
- Yeah, we were gonna get scalper's tickets.
- No need.
No need.
- We will hook you up.
I will hook you up.
- No kidding? - Wow.
- Don't you even worry about that.
You should've brought this idea up a long time ago.
Thanks.
- This is exciting.
- Okay.
Gotta call Jerry.
- Oh! - Maybe I'll do that in the car.
You know who you've got to call? Cheryl, to tell her that she's gonna be in a "Seinfeld" reunion show.
I know what you're up to.
You're so full of it.
We're sitting up there, you say, "I'll do it" and I'm going "Really? You'll do it?" And literally, it hit me the second we walked out of that meeting.
It's like "Oh! This is your plan to get your ex-wife back.
" Pretty ing brilliant if you ask me.
Well, I mean, think of it this way: I'm gonna I'll be with her every day on the set, directing her, working with her.
- She'll see me in this whole new light.
- As a working man.
And already she started looking at me differently when I told her - I was going for the meeting.
- I know.
This is great.
And I'm a hero now with NBC.
So I'm all for it.
I'm gonna back you on this the whole way.
Pretty brilliant.
Good afternoon.
I've got this really good idea for George.
He's gotten married, divorced and now he's trying to get his ex-wife back.
- I think that could be funny.
- Yeah, that's not bad.
But anyway, there's no shortage of ideas.
But why would we do something like this? I mean, I remember you talking about whenever a sitcom does a reunion episode you say, "Isn't it pathetic?" - I said pathetic? - Desperate, pathetic.
- Desperate? - When we would watch shows other shows we'd see them do reunion shows, you would look and you'd make that face you know, that very judgmental face of yours - I did? where you see people who do not have your aesthetic standards.
You criticize and downgrade them for it.
That's your style.
- Criticizing and downgrading? - Yes.
What's not quite clear to me is how you seem to have shifted your whole attitude about these shows.
- I haven't shifted.
- No, you've shifted.
- No, there's no shift.
- There's a shift.
- No shift.
- I'm being sold something here and I don't know why.
I get that funny feeling, like when you're in a car showroom and the guy is just trying to close that deal on the car.
It it's just weird to me that you suddenly like an idea that you always always hated.
I don't know.
It'd just be fun to get together.
Get together? You're not a get-together guy.
You don't like to get together.
You hate to get together.
We could have a dinner.
Why don't we just have a nice dinner? I just think that everybody wants it.
Why are we depriving them of this? It's crazy.
I know, but it's like you're going back to an old girlfriend and saying "Hey, maybe I can make it work now, Does that ever work in any relationship that you can think of? Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood.
How about that? They got divorced and they got back together.
And then she slipped off the boat and died.
- So how did that work out? - It was an accident.
And Christopher Walken? How do you explain that? I don't know what he was doing on the boat.
Just tell me why isn't it lame? Why isn't isn't it lame? Because we'll do it in a way that won't be lame.
- We will.
- Yeah.
I can't argue with that.
- Let me talk to the others.
- All right.
If I get the others, will you go along with it? I guess I would, yeah.
- Really? - I trust your instincts.
- I trust you.
- I'm telling you, it's gonna be funny.
And what about that story you were talking about how George would have an ex-wife? - Yeah.
- You know who'd be great - for that is Meg Ryan.
- Are you kidding me? - Yes, Meg Ryan.
- Meg Ryan? - L - I saw her in this thing the other night.
She got up and talked, she looks great.
- She's funny.
She's great.
- I don't know.
I think we'd rather go with an unknown.
You know what? Casting will take care of itself.
- Yeah.
It will.
- We'll, you know - It will.
Let's do it.
- Fantastic.
- All right.
Okay.
- All right.
- I'm gonna talk to the others.
- That sounds great.
Okay.
The big thing for George is the ex-wife who left him - Yes.
and he wants to get her back.
No one's gonna buy it.
The character is unlovable.
He is a you know, he's a jerky, schmucky little character.
All right? He's just a buffoon.
He's so unappealing that to buy that there was a marriage - that's sustained at all - All right, first of all, why is he unappealing? People loved the character.
Because he's selfish, he's stupid, he lies - Yeah, but people he's not stupid.
he's abrasive, he's inept.
- He's funny.
Everything you just said is funny.
- Yeah, it's funny.
- Okay, so maybe that's why It's funny 'cause everybody laughs at him, 'cause we all know schmucks like that.
But what I like about it here's the upside to it, really it could make up for the finale.
That's for sure.
What does that mean? "Make up for the fin" there's nothing to make up for.
It really lets us end "Seinfeld" on a good note.
It could be a "We know.
We know.
We're sorry.
" On that level I like it.
And, creatively, it makes me my juices are going.
- My juice is going.
- Wait.
What what's going on in this restaurant? - Oh, the photos? - Yeah.
Boy, those are distracting, huh? - But anyway, what were you saying? - And Julia everybody is down for this? I mean, have you talked to Julia about this? - I was supposed to meet with her today - Yeah? but she said she had to drive her daughter to a birthday party.
And she kinda blew me off, so I don't know.
But I'm gonna meet with her tomorrow.
Jerry'll do it if you do it.
- And Michael yes? - I haven't spoken to him yet, but I'm gonna meet with everybody.
All right.
You know what? Let's do it.
You know what? Let's do it.
I'm excited.
- Great.
- This is gonna work.
- It's gonna be great.
- And you know what? For George's ex-wife, if we get one of these great actresses that has the little bit of the funny voice you know, like a Jennifer Tilly, like a Kristin Chenoweth.
You don't need to concern yourself so much with who's playing George's wife.
- It's not concern.
I'm excited.
- Next thing I know, you're gonna be what, you're gonna be writing with me.
- You need some ideas? - No, we're good.
- 'Cause there were a few things - Yeah, all right.
that I pitched over the years you didn't - Yeah, whatever.
- They weren't that great.
- And it's nice.
- We'll go out on a good note this time.
- We'll have a great time.
We went out we already went out on a Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Ah yes, thank you.
- I hope everything was great.
- It was fantastic.
- We don't need to go out on a good note.
- We went out on a good note.
- And we'll do it again.
What are you going to leave? Let's coordinate the tip here.
- Why? - Well, when we split the check, we both have the exact same bill.
So why don't we leave the same thing so one of us doesn't look like an idiot? What, are we favored nations all of a sudden for lunch? No, but what is the big deal if we both leave the same amount? What do you want to leave? What's your inclination? - $12.
- $12? - Yeah.
- Good.
Put down $12.
- Write write $12 down.
- How much are you gonna leave? - Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- What's your plan here? I'm encouraging you to leave $12.
I think it's a number.
There's nothing to be ashamed of in writing $12 under "Gratuity" on your check.
Are you gonna leave $12? You want to know what I'm leaving? I'm gonna write down what I'm leaving right now.
I'm writing a number.
Now I'm folding that number and I'm putting it inside my little leather check holder.
Waiter.
Thank you very much.
- No problem.
Thank you.
- You've been wonderful.
Thank you.
You're not gonna tell me what you left? Is that it? I am very excited about our show.
You don't believe in tip coordination, is that it? Let's stay in touch about the girl.
It's very important.
I've got a couple of ideas.
I'll email you.
This is exciting, Larry.
And some funny ideas for Elaine.
- Oh, really? Like what? - Yeah.
A little girl asks you to give her doll a haircut.
- Mm-hmm.
- You give her the haircut, she finds out it doesn't grow back and she freaks out.
- Yeah, Elaine around a kid.
- Around the kid, the mother yelling at her.
- So that could be funny.
- Uh-huh, but I don't know.
I have to tell you, Larry, I've never seen a reunion show - that was not tacky.
- Yeah, l I mean, every time you see one of these reunion shows, it feels like they're doing it for the wrong reasons.
- Really? - Hey, is Jerry into it? Completely into it.
He's chomping at the bit.
- Really? - Is it chomping or champing? I think it's chomp champing? What is champing? I think it's spelled "champing" but pronounced "chomping.
" No, it's spelled "chomping" and it's pronounced "chomping.
" - Not so sure.
- I'm so sure.
- Really? Hmm.
- Yeah.
Chomp.
Well, regardless, Jason into it, - wants to do it.
- Oh my God.
- L - Come on, let's do it.
Okay, well, maybe all right.
All right.
- I'm into it.
- Fantastic.
I've got to go get this.
Be right back.
- Can I get you anything to drink? - No thanks, I'm good.
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yeah.
- Hey! - Hey.
- How's it going? - It's good.
How was the birthday party the other day? What birthday party? You know, you went to a birthday party with your mother.
No, I didn't go to a birthday party.
- Really? - Yeah, really.
That's not what your mother said.
I didn't go to a birthday party.
Huh.
Interesting.
I've got some really good ideas for Kramer.
This one idea that actually happened to me I picked up a hooker so I could use the carpool lane to get to Dodger Stadium 'cause I was late for a ballgame.
That happened to me.
I've spoken to Jason, he wants to do it.
Jerry will do it.
I just talked to Julia, she's in.
What do you think? Huh? Do you like that idea? - Huh? - Yeah.
Mmm.
- Good idea, right? - Oh, yeah.
I mean, am I crazy? Tell me.
What do you think? - Hmm? - Yeah.
- Am I crazy? - Hmm? Am I crazy? Do you think I'm crazy? I don't know.
Okay, I'm glad you said that.
I'm glad you think I'm crazy.
That means it's a good idea.
If you think it's a crazy idea, then it's a good idea.
If you said, "No, you're not crazy," then I'd think it's not a good idea.
- You know what I'm talking about? - Yeah.
- Huh? You get that, right? - Definitely.
Sure.
- So what do you think? - Yeah.
What? - Let's do it.
- Do it? Come on, let's do it.
- Let's do it.
- What time do you have? I'm sorry.
I've got to pick up Beth.
Oh, okay.
I've got the check.
What are you doing? - You can get this? Just a tea.
- Of course.
Yeah, come on.
- You had a tea.
Come on.
- Okay, all right.
- This is exciting.
Are you excited? - Yeah.
- Huh? It's exciting.
- Yeah yeah.
It was good seeing you.
- It's exciting, right? - I've gotta go.
I'll see you later.
- Great to see you.
I'm excited.
- All right.
- How are we doing over here, sir? - Doing good.
- Good good.
- Doing good.
- Anything I can get you? - No.
I have a question I want to ask you.
- Okay.
- I was sitting here yesterday.
- Yeah.
- Would you mind telling me how much tip the guy I was with left you? Oh.
We don't do that.
- You don't do what? - We don't share - that information with customers.
- Huh, "share information"? Honestly, who gives a crap? I was in here.
I was with a guy.
I'm just curious.
What did he leave? It was a healthy healthy tip.
- Was mine a healthy tip? - Yeah.
Was his healthier? - L l - Let me ask you this question: - Was it over $12? Huh? - Do you want me to refill your water or Just scratch your face with your finger if it was over $12.
L I could really get in trouble with my manager.
Nobody even knows what we're talking about.
Scratch your face with your finger if it was over $12.
Go ahead, just scratch it.
Was it over $12? - Oh, for God's sake.
What an asshole.
- Is there anything else? Let me ask you this question: Was it over $15? Just tug on your tie up here.
Was it over $15? This is making me real uncomfortable.
Nobody's even to anything we're talking about.
Was it over $15? Tug on your tie.
- Oh my f oh ! - Sir? Is that all I can get you? No, don't go yet.
One second.
I have one more question to ask you.
Did that son of a bitch give you a $20 tip? - What if it was more? - How much did he give you? - Huh? Was it over $30? - Do you want the check? Yeah, if it's over $30, I want you to raise that cup over that pot.
- Okay, I hope you enjoyed your meal - Yeah, thank you.
and come back soon.
- Larry: Hey! - Hi, how are you? Good.
Guess what.
- What? - I've got some news.
They're all in.
- Really? - We're doing the reunion show.
- Fantastic, man! - Is that unbelievable? It's unbelievable.
Who'd have thunk? Now check this out.
Susie has Lyme disease.
- Who saved her life? Who saved her life? - Can you I saved her life.
- You saved her life.
- Dr.
David.
- Dr.
David.
Paging Dr.
David.
- You know, she went to - Calling Dr.
David.
- How many doctors did she go to? I mean, that's kind of scary.
- I'll be right back.
- All right.
Cheryl! Hey, Cheryl! Hey.
Oh, I'll I'll catch up with you guys inside.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- This is crazy.
- Yeah.
- How are you? Good.
- Good.
Good.
So remember I was telling you that I was gonna see them about a "Seinfeld" reunion? - Yeah.
- We're doing the show.
- You're kidding.
- No.
And you are gonna play George's ex-wife.
- I am? - Do you want to? - Oh my God! - Huh? - Are you kidding me? - I swear to God.
- Can you act? Huh? - Yes.
- You can? Are you sure? - I can.
I am very good.
- You're not gonna embarrass me, are you? - No.
- I mean, I've got to talk to Jerry.
- Thank you so - I'm sure he won't have a problem with it.
- Oh my God, Larry.
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.
I can't tell you how much that means to me.
- Thank you.
- Wow.
Oh my God, you have no idea what this means to me.
- Really? - Okay, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah, I've just got to talk to Jerry.
- Thank you so much.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm telling you, it was unbelievable.
You should've seen the look on her face.
- I couldn't get over it.
- Here are your tickets, sir.
Thank you.
We'll go see a fantastic game, huh? - It's all working out.
- Yeah.
Where are these? And the home team, your Los Angeles Look at this.
This has to be a mistake.
He couldn't have given us seats up here.
- This is a joke.
Just a joke.
- Oh my God.
Can you believe these seats this guy gave us? Look at this.
You've gotta be kidding.
- #5 - Unbelievable.
This is crazy.
We could've stayed home - and watched it on TV.
- I could have ridden the treadmill, watched it on TV and gotten the same effect.
Why? Why would he do this? Why would he give - did he do it on purpose? - I don't know.
Should we give him the benefit of the doubt? - Yeah, I guess.
- I'm not used to giving people the benefit of the doubt.
I don't even know how to condition myself to do it.
I thought he had courtside seats.
Can l can I borrow your binoculars for a second? - Yeah, sure.
- Sir, thank you very much.
Oh, he does have courtside seats.
He's sitting in them he and David Spade.
- What? - He's sitting next to David Spade.
I can't believe it.
I'm gonna call him.
ing asshole.
- Oh! - What? He screened my call.
- How do you know he screened your call? - I saw him on the binoculars.
He screened the call.
You know, I always thought people were doing that when I called them.
This just confirms it.
See, it taught me a lesson.
I was gonna give somebody the benefit of the doubt I almost did and then something said "No, don't.
" Don't.
It's not for you.
" That's not my thing.
That was a complete and utter waste of time.
- Oh, what a waste of time.
- Why'd we even stay the whole time? - I don't even know.
- Oh, Sandy Goodman.
Listen.
Just don't go nuts.
All right? I know you want to say something, but don't - I'll talk to you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey, Larry.
I'm glad you made it.
- Yeah.
- Did you enjoy the game? Well You told the head of NBC to go  himself? Yeah, I did.
The guy said he's gonna fix me up with tickets.
He puts me up in the rafters, the worst seats.
- So what? - Then I caught him screening my call! So you crap on the head of the network? What are you doing? He's apoplectic.
Apoplectic, Larry.
That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable! - Yeah.
- You want to know what else is unacceptable? It is totally and completely unacceptable that you would grill my daughter Gracie about whether I took her to a birthday party.
And then you call me a liar? Okay, first of all, I didn't really grill her.
I just asked a question.
And I didn't call you a liar.
I just said it was interesting.
What about this would you find interesting, Larry? Well, the fact that you told me that you were taking her to a birthday party and she said she never went to the birthday party.
So I thought that was interesting.
Do you also find it interesting that, in fact, I have two daughters? Grace and Mary.
I took Mary to the birthday party.
- That's interesting.
- What I find interesting in fact, fascinating is that you would go back to a restaurant where you and I had a meal for the sheer purpose of harassing a waiter for the most insignificant incident, I'm sure, that's ever happened in this man's life.
We split a check and he doesn't want to coordinate the tip! - Why should I? - Why should you? Why do I need to coordinate the tip? You go out with a friend, you tip in concert! Why are we in concert? There's no concert! - Two different people, two different tips.
- We're not in concert! - A tip is a solo, Larry.
- No, it's not! - Thank you.
Thank you.
Solo.
- You tip in concert! - A tip is a solo.
- What is the big secret? He's got a big secret! What is the big secret?! You're digging into my personal you-you gotta know what my taxes are?! - Wanna know what I paid for my house?! - No, I just think it's the right thing to do! That's all! There's no right and wrong to it.
In fact, you're wrong and I'm right! - That's not even the big issue here.
- There we go.
Because unless you apologize to Sandy Goodman, there's not even going to be a reunion show.
What reunion show? - Didn't you tell him? - Yes, what are you talking about? We discussed it the other day at lunch.
- I don't remember you telling me that.
- What? You told me point blank.
You discussed it.
Everybody's - This is not cool.
- I did discuss it! Look, a reunion show let's do it.
It's a great idea.
All right, you've got all the principals, but the project's in the toilet because Larry David doesn't want to sit in the loge.
I don't think that was the loge.
That was way up.
Larry, you have got to speak with Sandy.
You have got to clean up that mess.
You've got to apologize.
I never should've left you alone with Goodman.
Jerry's right.
You've got to apologize.
Fine.
Oh, what, are you are you gonna go in begrudgingly - or are you gonna go in sincere? - Begrudgingly.
You can't give a begrudging apology.
You've gotta give a sincere apology.
I'll go somewhere between begrudging and sincere.
How's that? Somewhere between? Where between? - I'll straddle the line.
- What kind of line? It's not completely sincere and it's not completely begrudging.
I'll tell you where the line is the line is you probably  up the apology.
That's the line.
If I  up the apology, then I'll apologize for the bad apology.
You can't apologize for an apology! You get one shot, that's it.
Hey, what about Cheryl? - Okay.
- There you go.
All right.
I'm gonna hate myself more than normally.
Hey, Jeff, did you see my cell phone? Uh, no, I did not.
Hi, Lar.
Oh, here it is.
All right, listen.
I've gotta run.
Don't forget to pick up Sammi, okay? - I'm not gonna forget.
- All right.
- Hey.
- What? No "Thank you, Larry, for saving my life"? Saving my life? How'd you save my life? - You didn't save my life.
- I diagnosed your illness.
All right.
Well, it's treated, and I'm feeling great.
- Give it up, man.
- Give what up? What kind of person doesn't say thank you to another person for saving their life? - Oh, Larry, thank you so much.
- I'm glad you're feeling better.
You saved my life.
I'd be dead without you.
- You would be! - Oh, bullshit! You know what happens to Lyme disease if it's left untreated? - What? - Everything goes the kidneys, the joints, - the lungs, the heart everything! - Well, then you should be very glad I'm feeling better, shouldn't you?! If somebody saved my life, I'd be ing kissing You didn't save my life, asshole! - You know what? - What? Next time I'm not gonna say anything, okay?! I'm gonna keep my mouth shut and let you die! You want me to die? Get the hell out of here.
You've got a little spot on your forehead.
- Get the hell out of here.
- Don't get it checked out.
- It's not skin cancer.
- Out out out out! Don't check that out, that little spot you got there.
I just wanted to apologize if I offended you or insulted you in any way.
So this is me apologizing.
It's about as sorry as I can get.
I guess my question is: Was it sorry enough? That's it? - No good? - "No good"? - Too begrudging? - Very begrudging.
Can I apologize for the apology? You know what? I want to put the kibosh on our relationship.
I can see where this road is going and I don't like it, so we're done.
