Finally.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- No good? - Larry! It tastes like you put the whole salt shaker up in here.
No, that's way too salty.
Way too salty.
All right, it's too salty.
I'm sorry.
Pfft, could you make it any hotter in here, by the way? - It feels good.
- It feels good? Yeah, it feels good.
I can't even sleep in this room at night, it's so hot.
- Honest to God.
- What temperature would you prefer? - 68 degrees.
- 68 degrees?! See, that's some white-people shit right there, LD.
Black people like it a little bit warmer at night, okay? - At least compromise.
- No no no, 75 degrees works for me, LD.
I'll call Leon.
Let's see what he says.
Leon! - Leon, come in here! - He'll tell you that's how we like it.
Okay, you know, I can't sleep.
It's too hot at night.
I want to sleep in 68 degrees temperature.
She wants to sleep in 75 degrees.
Let's compromise at 72 degrees.
 that, Larry.
You my mothering man, Larry, but 72 degrees? Shit.
You might as well sleep outside.
I'm an 82 degrees man myself.
- See there, I told you! - 82 degrees, that's my shit.
That's my region.
- You really wanted it 68 degrees.
- 6-ing-8? He said 68 degrees? - Get the  outta here.
- It's like a frigerator.
- Oh my goodness.
- You take that shit? - Bring a honey to the hotel and shit - Right! get up in that motherer.
It's all cold and shit got to heat her ass up.
All right now, you make sure you do your homework before you watch that TV.
- Hey, hi! - Hey, Larry.
- What's up? - Hey, I got some shows Tivo'd.
Don't erase them.
They erase all my Tivo'd shows.
You know what, Larry? There's been another robbery in this neighborhood.
I was just talking to the neighbors.
It's the third one this month.
What are you talking to the neighbors for? They came over and let me know what's going on.
You don't need to talk to the neighbors, okay? Yeah, but, Larry, there's been a robbery.
I'd rather have the thieves than the neighbors thieves don't impose.
- What are you talking about? - The neighbors want your time.
The thieves want your things.
I'd rather give them things than time.
Listen, have you heard anything from the doctor about Loretta's biopsy? No no, they said a couple of days.
Oh.
You know, at first I was really worried, Larry.
But no matter what the outcome is, Loretta has you by her side.
You know, things could get bad, Larry, but she's got you to hold her hand.
And if she has to do chemo and it causes her to lose her hair and throw up and all that, you gonna be right there by her side.
Thank you, Larry.
in that room at night.
It's like I'm Cinderella in there, I swear to you.
- Cinderella? What do you mean? - You never saw the fairy tale? No no, I know Cinderella.
But what aspect of Cinderella? What do you mean? - What aspect do you think I mean? - I don't know.
- The shoe? - She's bossed around by the stepmother! Oh, the evil stepmother.
So you're comparing her to an evil stepmother? - I'm comparing me - Don't get mad at me! - Well, you're so stupid! - Don't get mad at me.
So that's what it's like, huh? That's terrible.
That's what it's like.
Exactly.
- That's what it's like.
- Oh, that's horrible.
- You know what the worst part is? - What? We're waiting for the results of this biopsy now.
I got about 24 hours to get out of this thing before the results come back.
Yeah, you can't break up with somebody who's got cancer.
You gotta break up with her before she gets those test results.
God, it's gonna be so hard.
- Why? What's the big deal? - What do you mean "the big deal"? The whole family's gotta move out it's a big deal! I'd much rather be in her position than mine any day of the week.
No, to be the breaker-upper you're in control.
Couples should have like a pre-breakup agreement before they start going out because every relationship will end at some point.
All you do is send a text.
You make an agreement "If you see the word 'apricot,' it means it's over.
" Okay, hypothetically, what if you or she are eating apricots at that point? - Can I tell you about apricots? - What what? You know, one in 30 is a good one.
- Okay.
- It's such a low-percentage fruit.
- Okay.
- Always a mealy dry - Hey, how's it going? - Hey.
- Hi, Lar.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
- Come to a dinner party tonight? - Tonight? - Yeah.
- Oh.
- You know you love my cooking.
It's a little late for an invitation, is it not? Well it's an invitation nonetheless.
- Who else is gonna be there? - Uh, eh, you don't need to know.
- Why not? - Because it's not done, that's why not.
- What do you mean it's not done? - It's a social convention that people don't ask who's going to be there at the dinner party.
- It's just not done.
- Big deal.
Why isn't it done? Because it isn't! I don't know the derivation of the convention.
Why are you following it blindly like this? You should be glad that it happens that way, because if I told people you were coming, they might not show up.
That's probably why people don't tell because if it gets out who's coming nobody would want to go.
So why even have it in the first place if people don't want to be with each other? I don't think that's why.
It's just not done.
What's the downside of telling me? I don't know that there is a downside, except that - you don't need to know.
- Who's coming? - Don't you dare tell him.
- What's that? - Who's coming? - I don't know.
Why do you even get started with her on this stuff? - That's my question.
- What time? - 7:30.
- You've got something to do.
- You'd better go do it.
- Not now, maybe tonight.
- All right.
- Thank you.
See you later.
Can't wait to see ya! - You take care of yourself, all right? - Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.
- We still don't know anything.
Oh.
Hi.
Oh shoot! I forgot I gotta feed those fish again.
It's like a huge responsibility feeding fish.
It's not fun.
Think about it, you know? I'm outside, I gotta go home and feed fish? I mean, seriously, who gives a shit? Mr.
David, I wanted to talk to you about your girlfriend.
You know, they're not pets, really.
But yet it's the same responsibility as a pet, but you get nothing back.
You watch them, is that supposed to be fascinating? I don't know.
Um - Can I talk to you about Loretta? - What do you think? - Well - Do you think she has think she has cancer? L I can't speculate about that right now.
We did a biopsy at the hospital and Let me ask you a question: Say you had to make a bet with Vegas on this, would you bet for cancer or against cancer? L l I don't get into that numbers game.
- You must have an idea.
- I don't.
- No idea? - No idea.
What is this thing? I've had this awhile.
- What is that? - It's just a skin tag.
Just put a little lotion on there.
But hold on a sec.
I'm gonna write you a few prescriptions to fill out.
I'm gonna prescribe Zithromax and Tylenol with codeine.
Now the Tylenol, that's just as needed for pain.
Again, in a few days any day, we'll have the biopsy back and that will help us determine what the next step is.
But right now, I want you to just stay calm, and what's wrong? You just go into the refrigerator without asking? I just got myself a lemonade.
Is that a I was just surprised you didn't ask.
- I'm surprised you didn't offer.
- Well, I was about to offer.
- I don't think you were about to offer.
- Well, I was gonna offer - If you hadn't offered me by now - It is a little unusual to go into someone's refrigerator without asking, is it not? I can tell when somebody's gonna offer me lemonade.
You were not going to offer me lemonade.
If anything, you were going to complain to me about being a fish owner or something.
- It is difficult to be a fish owner.
- Why is that a priority?! - Your girlfriend is sick.
- I didn't say it's a priority.
I just said they need to be fed and it's something that I need to think about.
You do not need to think about that.
What you need to think about is the sick woman upstairs.
I'm thinking about that.
And by the way, why couldn't you ask? - Why couldn't - Are you so dainty you can't say - "May I please have a glass of water?" - I am not dainty! "May I have a piece of pie?" It could be tuna fish it doesn't matter.
- You know.
- No, it does matter.
Here, you want? Take take this.
- A hot day a mover comes here - You want this? you say, "You want some tuna fish?" - You want this little pear? Don't condescend to me with your tiny pear.
I'm not the one that has a problem here.
You are, my friend.
- You are.
- Yeah.
- Okay, fine.
- Yeah, fine.
- Hey, Dr.
Schaffer.
- Hello.
Did you see that? Did you see that guy? - What was that whole thing? - He goes in my refrigerator.
- Come on, you don't do that.
- What did he take? - Lemonade.
- Liquids are okay.
I don't believe that people should go into my refrigerator.
- What kind of a stupid rule this that? - What do you mean? I don't go into other people's refrigerators.
You could go into my refrigerator.
- I don't go into your refrigerator.
- You're a welcome guest.
Hey, how's your sister, by the way? - Bam Bam? - Yeah.
- Thanks for asking.
She's doing better.
- Really? Yeah.
I'm really glad we took her out of that mental institution.
- That's good.
- Yeah, I'm excited.
You know, if there's anything I can do you let me know.
You know what? There is something you can do.
- What? - Yeah, you can come over today at 1:00 and visit with her.
- Visit her? What, are you kidding? - Yeah.
- Why, you didn't mean it? - Of course not! Why did you say it then? You know, it was some an empty gesture.
- It was something to say.
- Guess what.
You said it.
Be there at 1:00.
But one thing when you go in the house, look at her shoes before she calls your name.
Don't look at her in the eyes.
She'd love to see you.
Oh, Christ.
I don't know how you take a statement like that seriously.
But you said it and you're gonna stick to it.
- And make her feel good! - All right.
I'll see you at Jeff's tonight.
What's at Jeff's? Oh.
Oh, he's, um, having a little dinner party.
I guess I wasn't invited.
I can't believe that.
Why don't you make sure before you ask somebody, "Am I gonna see you tonight?" - That they were invited? - I just assumed you were going.
- Don't assume anything.
- If they had told me who was coming to the party, I would have known and I wouldn't have asked, but they refused to tell me.
It's not your job to find out who's going to a party.
All I want you to do is entertain my sister for two hours and then you can go to your goddamn dinner party.
- She better not be dangerous.
- Be there at 1:00, okay? I'll be there! I gotta sit in a room with that nut? - You look good.
- You do.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Thank you, Jeff.
And I appreciate the effort, Larry.
- No effort.
- No, it was effortless.
Okay, then we're all happy.
Yeah.
So what's new? Right? So what's happening? Guess who told Marty to shut up.
- I give up.
- Why, what did he say? Who? - He didn't tell you? Oh, come on.
- No no.
She's great a great actress.
- Angelina Jolie? - No! You know who I mean.
She's an actress.
- Who who? - She said shut up right to Marty.
- Nicole Kidman? - No! - Julia Roberts? - No! She's a multi multi-talented.
Oh, I know, I know! Hannah Montana.
- No, you're not even trying! - I'm trying! - The Kardashians! - What? No! You know who it is! - Do you have any idea? - No.
Yeah, you do.
Got anything to eat? - No.
- Anything to drink? - Nope.
- Nothing to eat or drink? - No, I'm sorry, nothing.
- Boy, that's interesting.
I know.
Really.
Isn't it? It is.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I was gonna go to the bathroom.
Can I go first? I just said I'm going to the bathroom.
- But I'm saying, could I go first? - No no, I'm going first.
- So when you come back, I'm gonna go.
- Yes.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey hey hey! Hey hey! Hey hey hey hey! Oh hey! Oh,  me, fat boy!  me, fat boy! - She's not a mental patient.
- You had sex with a mental patient! - She's not a mental patient.
- She's a mental patient.
- She's living at Funkhouser's.
- She's a mental patient.
If I went over to the institution and ed her, then she's a mental patient.
What happened? I got up to go to the bathroom.
I was sitting there and she said, "I'm bored.
" I said, "If there's anything I can do" - You said that? - That's it.
- An empty gesture? - An empty gesture.
- That's how this whole thing started.
- That's how it started - and then I'm off banging her.
- Jesus.
You can't make an empty gesture to a Funkhouser.
They take you up on it.
How come you don't have a doorbell? You know what you did? You totally ed me.
- What? - You ed me.
What are you talking about? What'd you tell Funkhouser about the party for? Pfft, oh, why? He said something? Yeah, he said something.
He called to complain he wasn't invited - and Susie invited him.
- Oh, that is so lame! You know that? - That is so lame to do that.
- And guess what else they did.
They brought Bam Bam.
Bam Bam's here! - What are you doing? - He brought that nutbag into my house! - Oh my God.
- What the  did you tell him for? If you had told me who was coming to the party in the first place, I never would have said anything to him because I would have known he wasn't coming.
It's crazy all these party rules: You can't tell who you're inviting, you can't tell anybody you're going and you can't talk about it after.
It's like living in East Germany or something.
Now I'm screwed.
Just look at this.
- This is crazy.
- What is that? Is that Dr.
Schaffer? What's he doing here? He had a party recently.
He invited us.
We're returning the favor.
- What's the big deal? - Again.
- Again what? - If I had known that he would be here, - I wouldn't have come.
- If I had known Bam Bam would be here, I would have left town! - Who's that guy with the doctor? - That's his boyfriend.
- What, seriously? - Yeah, he's gay.
- Oh my God, I didn't know that.
- Yeah, listen, I gotta go help Susie.
Okay.
Hey, how you doing? - Hi, Mr.
David, how are you? - Good.
- This is Sam.
- Hi.
It's good to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I didn't know you were gay.
Uh, yeah.
Is that a surprise to you? Yeah, I'm a little surprised, yeah.
- Why? - I don't know.
- I just didn't think you were gay.
- What is that supposed to mean? It doesn't mean anything.
It means I was surprised to discover that he's gay.
- That's what it means.
- Why? How would I seem if I was gay? - What is seeming gay? - You seem slightly gay and you don't.
So I wouldn't be surprised if somebody told me that he was gay, but I'm surprised that somebody tells me you're gay.
It's no big deal.
Is that a crime? - No, it's not a crime.
It's just odd.
- It's not a crime.
- And it's a little bit offensive.
- I'm sorry if you're offended.
- I didn't say anything offensive.
- I don't accept your apology 'cause I don't believe that you are sorry.
How about if I said I'm pleasantly surprised? You're living in another decade, Mr.
David.
- I don't think I am.
- Well, I think you are.
- Okay? - All right, fine.
- Fine, we disagree.
- Okay, we'll agree to disagree.
All right, great.
Unbelievable.
What did you do with Bam Bam? What? Nothing.
What do you mean? - When you came over to the house.
- I didn't do anything.
It's like a miracle.
I've never seen her spirits like this.
I mean, the medicine and your visit - she's a different person.
- That is fantastic! - What great news.
- I can't thank you enough.
L you shouldn't be giving me any of the credit.
- This is the man come here.
- What? - He says Bam Bam is - Shhh! is like a new person.
- How about that? - That's great.
- Were you there too? Yeah! No wonder she was singing "I love the fat boy.
" - I couldn't figure it out.
- I love the fat boy.
- How about that? - It's great.
I can't thank you guys enough! - Oh.
- Pleasure.
- What did you do? - We just sat and talked with her.
- That's all.
- Did you play any games? - No no no.
- I laid some games out.
- No.
- No games, uh-huh.
Did you play a million Pick-up Sticks? - No no.
- The key to the whole thing? You treat them normal and they really respond.
I love both of you and you gotta promise me you'll do it again.
- If we have time.
- It's possible.
Oh no, you gotta promise.
- Ehhh - We'll see.
- Just say you'll go over there.
- Dinner is served! - Let's go have some dinner.
- Thank you so much! - So you're saying that it works? - Absolutely it works.
- I do it every day.
- And, Sam, you've used it? - You made the salad, right? - I made it and I love it.
Susie, these ingredients are very fresh and well prepared.
Oh, thank you, Bam Bam.
That's so sweet of you.
I'm so glad you were able to join us.
I'm so glad you still have food in your fridge - considering Larry's around.
- What is that? What do you mean? Larry likes to clean out fridges like he did today at Marty's house.
- What? - You were into our fridge - uninvited, right? - That's ridiculous.
Oh? Then might you explain the whereabouts of the freshly-sliced deli-packaged turkey - I don't even eat turkey.
the yellow mustard in a glass jar - and the lemonade soda? - What?! Oh, lemonade? So you're a hypocrite too? Because I had lemonade at your house and you threw pardon me a shit fit.
Are you kidding? She's emotionally unstable.
Are you gonna believe a word this woman says? You know, I don't mind if you take liquid, but when you take regular food, I have a problem.
I didn't take anything! That's crazy.
Speak the truth.
Help him with the truth, would you, Jeff? I wouldn't know.
I actually wasn't there in the kitchen.
You were you were oh no, you weren't.
I know where you were! - You were in bed with me.
- What? Come on.
- What did you say? - What did you say? What the  is she talking about, Jeff? What the hell did you do? - Oh, I did nothing.
- He didn't do anything.
Did you take advantage of this poor deranged girl? - You are sick! - Shame on you.
- That's disgusting.
- What did you do now? - Seriously, huh? - You sick ing pervert.
You're you're serving nothing but lies here.
I'm not hungry.
- Come on! - What did you do to her, Jeffrey? - How could you do that? - She's ing nuts! She's a nutbag! She's a nutbag.
- I did not do anything.
Crazy! - He'll sleep with a mental patient? All right, all right, all right! I believe you! Even Bam Bam is not crazy enough to sleep with you, okay? - Only I am.
- There you go.
- There you go.
- That's exactly That's exactly right.
Of course.
Okay, everybody, everybody, I want to apologize for the Funkhouser family.
Oh, stop.
It's not necessary.
- No no.
- No need to apologize.
I'm going to have to take her back to the institution.
I'm gonna tell you something: I think it would be good for her.
And you're doing it for her own safety, for her own good.
- No, I'm not so certain.
- No, it's good.
It would be fantastic.
It's a great thing, because you've gotta think of the long haul.
In the long haul, you want her back.
- Maybe she needs help back.
- You want to help her.
Look look look, just drop it.
Let's enjoy our dinner.
I'm sorry this happened.
The best salad anybody ever made.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Hello? What? Hold on, hey, what? Oh, okay.
All right, I'll go pick it up.
No, I'll leave right now.
- You're leaving? - I'm so sorry.
I have to go.
I have to pick up Loretta's medication.
- You didn't give it to her yet? - I've gotta get it from the pharmacy.
- I'm sorry, she's sick.
- I haven't served the entree yet.
It's sad because I'm having so much fun here, and then and I gotta go and maybe I'll come back.
No, don't bother coming back.
Go go go! I got the prescription, Auntie Rae.
I'm just gonna get some food to go.
- Could you do me a favor? - What? Could you go up to Loretta and ask her what the name of that restaurant was we ate in in Santa Monica a few weeks ago? - No.
- Why not? - Because she's resting.
- Is she sleeping? - No.
- Can she talk? - Yes.
- So let her talk.
No.
I don't want her talking.
I want her resting.
Resting? What does resting even mean? She's not sleeping, is she? You can talk and rest.
Larry, I am not gonna bother Loretta with this bullshit.
Do you hear me? She resting.
Bye.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Mr.
David.
Nice to see you.
- I'd like some food to go.
- Oh, I just sat your party.
- Party? - Yeah, you had a reservation.
I have a reservation? Let me see.
"Larry David, 2.
" My God.
Thank you.
Well well.
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, hello.
My man.
How's it going, brother? - Pretty good.
- Give me some.
All right.
What, are you using my name to get a table in here? Well, it's so crowded.
I just thought you'd - Really? have a better chance.
- Did you? Ah.
- Yeah.
You want to join us? You could eat with us.
- Are you sure? Really? - Please.
- Sit down.
- I miss you.
- You sure? - Yeah, mm-hmm.
- Great.
- Oh, by the way, I put you up for an NAACP lmage Award.
- Yeah yeah.
- You did? Fingers crossed, baby.
I think you'll win.
- Oh, thank you.
- How is Loretta? Oh, she's she's yeah.
- Yeah? - Yeah, she's good.
How's the no-fly underwear guy? Um, it's not happening.
- It didn't work out.
- Really? Yeah.
Maybe Larry's people can hook you up with somebody.
You know Lil Wayne? You know Lil Wayne.
Oh, like this.
Yeah.
I can't I can't read my - menu.
- It's so dark in here.
- It's so dark.
I honestly have - Unbelievable.
This is insane.
How do they expect people to read this menu? - Honestly? - You can't.
I've got a candle here and I can't read it.
- I'm gonna go outside.
- Oh yeah, I'm gonna go outside.
- I'll go out with you.
- Larry, what you putting on your hair? - I like that.
- Posner.
You learning, Larry.
Hang in there, baby.
Oh, look, the Caesar salad.
- Caesar salad.
- You used to get that.
- That's very good here.
- Right.
With the 200 croutons.
A lot of croutons.
There were a lot of croutons.
Ton of croutons.
I can't believe I'm sitting here with you.
- Weird.
- Huh? - It's weird.
- It's crazy.
- Isn't it? - I really miss you.
- I miss you too.
- You do? Well kind of.
I mean, I do, I do.
It's just what was happening was not working for me.
- It just wasn't I don't know.
- What? It got to this place where you were always at the house and you didn't have anything to do and you it was just different.
Like when you were working on "Seinfeld," you had a job and you'd get up and you'd go, like, do something with other people.
- Okay.
- And then you'd come home and it was like that was the right amount of Larry.
- This is that was - I understand.
too much.
- Too much Larry, I get that.
Okay, too much Larry.
We can reduce Larry in half.
We can reduce Larry to a third.
We can reduce Larry to three hours a day.
- That's - Huh? Slivers of Larry is better.
I get that.
Look, I understand.
I've got 24-hour Larry, you think I like it? - Hello? - Larry, Dr.
Schaffer just called.
He's on his way over to the house right now.
He's got the results of the biopsy.
- He's coming to the house right now? - Uh-huh.
I'm on my way! Is everything okay? - Uh, yeah.
I gotta go.
- Is it an emergency? Yeah, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you.
I gotta go get out of something.
Shit, damn it! Come on, schmohawk.
Larry! - Oh my God.
- What took you so long? Never mind.
Apology accepted.
Now call Marty.
- Bam Bam - Call Marty.
- I'll go in the house - You're lying! Just tell me, you lied, right? You lied, Jeff enjoyed.
Dirty God Oh! Oh my God! Don't look at them, Larry.
Don't get eye contact.
- Oh my God.
- Go! Go! Go! - Holy Jesus! - Nice! - Oh my God.
- Only call Marty.
- What? Yeah, I am.
- Call Marty.
- Get out of the way.
- No! - I gotta get in there, Bam Bam.
- No ow! Call him.
- Get your cell out.
- Bammer, what are you doing here? Tell him Jeff said I was in the top 10! Tell him.
Stop it.
Calm down.
Tell Marty Jeff enjoyed me.
You should not have left the house.
Folks, we had a report of a break-in.
Did you see anything? Okay, she'll give you a statement.
I've gotta get in the house.
- I'll take your statement now.
- No, she can't give you a statement.
She's not qualified to make a statement.
She's crazy.
What?! No, she's not crazy.
Yeah, after what she said at dinner tonight, she's crazy.
- Oh no no, she - I'm taking her back to the home.
- I'm taking her back.
- If she can't give one, I'll need a statement from you.
Have a good night.
Sir, did you see a vehicle? Was it individuals? What happened? What exactly did you see? Sir, your attention here, sir, if you would, please.
All right, well, I saw a guy jump over a hedge across the street.
He had a Oh, the doctor's coming.
Larry.
Folks, I wish that I had better news for you.
The biopsy came back positive for cancer.
- Now - Oh, Larry, Larry! - Mr.
David, Mr.
David, are you okay? - Oh my goodness, Larry.
- Are you with me? - Come on, Larry, come on.
Okay, all right.
- I know this can be very upsetting.
- Dr.
Schaffer, - can I go in and see her? - Yes.
It's gonna be okay.
Now this is really where the hard work starts.
She's gonna need a lot of help.
There's a lot of vitamins, a lot of medicines that she's gonna need.
Organic juices three times a day.
I would keep the house warmer.
Keep it at about 78� to 82� minimum.
The warmer the better, really.
That helps with the healing process.
I know this is a lot to take in, but if you guys work hard, especially you, in two, three, four years, she's hopefully gonna be fine.
- Did you say four years? - Could be, yeah.
And your life is mostly going to be taking her to appointments or here with her in the house.
I-I can still play golf.
Absolutely not.
I don't imagine you'd have time for that.
- Once a week? - No times a week.
- You won't have time for that.
- What? Nine holes.
Zero holes, Mr.
David! This is serious.
Now I won't lie things are going to get ugly.
There's going to be vomiting.
There's going to be incontinence, depression, unsightly hair loss, weight loss.
She'll be irritable.
Lots of massive mood swings.
She could get violent.
Hysteria, incontinence have I already said that?
