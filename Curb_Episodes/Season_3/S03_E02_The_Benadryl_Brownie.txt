I don't like it's too flashy.She's a Christian Scientist and She's a what? She's a Christian Scientist? She's a Christian Scientist, and I, it's Oh, dear.- Did you just say, "Oh, dear"? - Yeah.I don't think you've ever said that in your entire life.No one's ever told me they were dating a Christian Scientist.- I've been saving it.- If anything called for an "Oh, dear" Holy cow, a Christian Scientist.It's a nightmare for me, because, I'm under the weather about 99% of my life, and she doesn't She won't bring you the medicine? - This is out of their - I know they can't take it, but can they touch it and give it to somebody else? She doesn't have a medicine chest in her place.Wait, one second.- Do you want more time? - No, no, it's fine.What you know, I want to get one of these, I don't have good luck with them.- That's the one I have.- You like this one? - I bought that not here.- You've got the same one? - Yeah, I love it.- It's a good phone, - it's an XR-71.- It's a great one.But it does go out on occasion, like in a tunnel or something.You can't hear a radio when you go in a tunnel.- Yes, you can, FM.You're an idiot.- I never listen to FM.- What do you listen to? - I listen to talk.You have a lot of program, a lot of rings in that.Okay, I'm gonna take this.Listen, I meant to ask you this, I have to hand in this special, and you know how I like you to watch it.It's not locked in yet.Now is the time to tell me if you think something's can you watch it?

The Emmys are this Sunday and I am not gonna miss them.We missed half the Knick game last year because of this shit.This is ridiculous.You're gonna have to fire Mike.- I'm not gonna fire him.- Why not?

So  ing idiotic you should have one goddamn remote and We should have one remote! You need to call him, Larry.Are you gonna call him? Well, maybe we should play Scrabble.- Nothing we can do.- That's a bad joke, right? Yeah, it is a joke, I mean, I don't Scrabble? It's a joke, but what are we supposed to do? You want to sit Shiva? Why don't we play Twister, would you be happy? If this was your show, then you would make every  ing plan Let's go upstairs and all get under the covers and sob.Why don't we go to my house and watch it?

I don't feel comfortable driving myself.She needs you to take her home.You know? I mean - Now.- All right, we're going.You're such a  ing idiot, how can you do this? - She's not looking well - Cell phone, you  ed up.Well, we'll watch it, don't worry.- That's horrible.- Scrabble? - I'd love to play Scrabble.- I said it and kind of got in the mood.- Let's get it.- Really?

I'm sorry, but I got five remotes, nothing's working.Just be honest, man.'Cause I'm black, right? Right? Why? That couldn't be crazier.Crazy.Why did I hire you? That was over the phone, You didn't know I was black at the time.All right, that's true, but I kept you around.But you're getting rid of me, right? I fire white people, I've fired white people.I have fired plenty of white people.I've been doing this Okay, okay.You know what? It's not even me.Can I be? Okay.You want can we be honest here?

You should take Benadryl.You'd knock that out in five minutes.The thing would be gone.You wouldn't even think about it.I can't believe I didn't think of that.That was one - I don't take medication.- Pop it in.- "Pop it in"? - Who's gonna know? Pop it in? That's a betrayal of my faith.Jesus would be very happy for you to look better than you do now.No one's watching.Pop, take a pop.Listen, I have spent my entire life in belief and faith.Well, why not just pray for the TV? Why even have somebody come in and fix the television? Why not just pray? Pray for the TV? What is that? What? Hey, by the way, is that guy any good? I don't know.It's my parents' house.We got all sorts of problems, you were there with all those remotes, and Cheryl, it's a pain in the neck.I just had to fire our guy.I'm looking for somebody.I'd like one remote that could take care of the whole thing.I don't know if he's good, Lar.Maybe you should ask him on your way out.Do you have one remote, or two? How many do you have? Oh, Richard? Oh, Larry.Come.Just in time.We're about to begin the prayer circle.You've gotta be kidding.Believe me, you don't want me in this.She'll wind up with tuberculosis.I really got bad karma, I'm not kidding.- Oh, yes, we do.- I beg to differ.Grab hands.Let us join hands.Oh, no, no.Not this arrangement.Let's do boy/girl here.Join hands.Join hands.Put her over here.No, she needs to be over there with her husband.And as we continue this healing light, we know, Jesus, that You are with us, and You are always with us, for Thine is the power, and the glory, forever and ever.No one can touch us, for God is always with us.- Oh, cell phone.I'm sorry.I just got this cell phone.Hello? Oh, hey.Maybe.Who are they playing? I'm gonna be humiliated.This is a  ing nightmare.You know why this is a nightmare? You, my friend.Yes, yes, you.Because of this  ing highfalutin you gotta go, join a restaurant, have an interest, have them come over and cook peanut sauce Hey.It had nothing to do with that.If it wasn't for the peanuts, she wouldn't look like a goddamn  ing Venetian! The cell phone that you recommended didn't work! That cell is used by every  ing person.- You don't know - Did you see my girlfriend? You said you didn't give a shit about the way she looks.Would you show up at an event Would /? with a person that looks like she has a macaroni salad about the soul, you love her soul and all that.Part of that is true, but this is unbelievable.I have to what kind of  ing why can't she take a Benadryl? These people, what are they doing? I don't understand this attitude.I don't understand it either.Take a Benadryl.She'll be better in five minutes.Can you imagine me getting out of the limo with my date? She's pretty hell bent on going too.She's got the dress, "I got the dress." - You know, I know, I know.- She's ready.Yeah, know what would match her head? A dress made of turnips and blood, you know? Oh, God, she's so hideous.She should look in the mirror.Does she even know what she looks like? - She denies it.It's a denial thing.- Why don't you take her? lt'll be fun.Oh, that's very oh, yeah, Mr.Big Shot.- Why don't you take her? - What do we do? You gotta help me out.You gotta get a shot and stick it in her ass - She's not a racehorse.- You gotta get a shot of Benadryl while she's sleeping, or shove it down her throat.Like a hit man? A Benadryl hit man? Put it in the brownie that she ate.Wait a minute, why not put it in? - Put it in the brownie? - That's a  ing brilliant idea.- A brilliant idea? - Yeah, because - yeah, it's a  ing! - What, the Benadryl brownie? First of all, she will never know.I've got news for you.Even if she got better, they would think it was because of the prayer.That's fantastic.Well, I mean, you could do it, it wouldn't be hard What, are they gonna throw me in prison? All I have to do is get the recipe from Susie, Cheryl would bake them, put it in, we'd just give her the brownie.- Larry, what are you doing here? - Hey, you got a dog.Well we need protection.It's me and Sammy in the house alone.He's a good boy.This is Oscar.Oscar! Oskie-boy! Hey, Oskie-boy! - Don't get him excited, okay? - Okay.Yeah.You just stop by, you don't call? No, I tried to call, but my cell phone couldn't get through.- Interference.- That's a piece of crap, that one.- I had that one, I got rid of it.- Really? Who's that? Isn't that somebody in the car? - It's Richard Lewis.- Oh, oh So, what? What do you want? Actually, this may sound a little strange, but we had a dinner party the other night and Jeff brought over some of your brownies Wait a minute.Jeff brought brownies that I made to a dinner party? - Yeah, at my house.- Larry, I baked those brownies specifically for Sammy to take to school the next day, and they were gone.I had no idea what the hell happened.Jeff stole he stole his child's brownies, Larry.You see what we're dealing with here? He stole brownies out of the mouth of his baby.It's a testament to the brownie.That's what you're not seeing.Because they're incredible brownies.If they were mediocre brownies, he wouldn't have taken them.- Well, that's true.- Which leads me to why I'm here.I would love if you could give me the recipe.- The brownie recipe? - The brownie recipe.- I can't do that, darling, I can't.- No, no, no, of course you can.No, I can't, because it's a secret family recipe my grandmother handed down to me, I can't.Susie, Susie, Susie.Look who you're talking to here.I'm talking to Larry David.Yeah, the guy who never ever tells anybody anyth/ng.I am known for that.Strangers come up to me to tell me their deepest secrets.Well, that's good to know for future reference for other things that I might need to trust you with, but this is a secret.What does that mean to you? Okay, okay, secret, secret, secret.I'll tell you a secret, how about that? Nobody knows, not even Cheryl.Well, if you'd like to tell me.- I might be losing a testicle.- You're kidding me.It's not definite.The point is, I'm telling you, I'm sharing something with you because I trust you.- The way you can trust me.- I cannot give you the recipe.- No, you can.- No, I can't.I can't.My grandmother, okay may she rest in peace entrusted that brownie recipe to me, and you're asking me to break a sacred confidence.It's not The Manhattan Project, you know?! It's just a little a recipe.Go get a mix or something! You're asking too much.You ask way too much.I can't.Oscar, come.I just told you I'm gonna lose a ball! Okay, so you want to put some Benadryl in some brownies? A lot of Benadryl.Are you kidding? What's the downside? Think of it, it's like it's an act of humanity on your part.I'm begging you.Aren't you guys supposed to be going to the Emmys tomorrow night? - Why? What? - Richard? Is that what this is about, Larry? Because you don't want to take her to the Emmys because of the way she looks? Why should he take her? She's hideous.I don't blame him.Are you guys out of your mind?! Why? It's not only that.I want her to get better.It's 90%.You don't have to lie to her - It's not 90-10.- It's 85-15.- No, no, 75-25.- It's not even that.Tell her the truth.You're embarrassed to be seen with her, and I don't blame him.So what? She takes a little Benadryl, you put it in the brownie, big deal.Why don't you buy some brownies, put it in and leave me out of this? - We went over this.- You know anything about tampering? Huh? Do you know anything about tampering? You can't do that because the brownie will fall apart.It's gotta be in the mix when you make the brownie.Maybe you guys should take care of this yourself - How can we? - I can't bake.- Leave me out of this.- I don't know how to bake.What do you mean? They have to be baked.They have to be baked.Don't you think she's gonna taste Benadryl in the brownies? It's totally tasteless.There's no taste to this stuff.There's no taste to it.I spoke to the pharmacist.Oh, you asked him if you put this in brownies, will someone be able to taste it? There's no taste to it at all.They're odorless and tasteless.My heart is breaking for her big head.It's grotesque.It's like she should be in a carnival on Coney Island, I'm telling you.This is the dumbest idea I have heard in a long time.You know what? It's a good idea, 'cause if it works, she thinks the prayer did it.That's what's so smart about it.Now the idea is a genius idea.It's not like, "How did I get better all of a sudden?" - It was their religion.- Yeah, it was their religion.- Prayer worked.- Yeah.And you know what? It happened in our house.- Okay.- Okay.All right, I think we should you know.All right, I just want to talk to her for a second.All right.Cheryl? All right, thanks for doing this.I guess this is stupid.- Do you not think this is stupid? - It's not such a big deal.Let's not make a big deal about it, okay? It's not really a big deal.- It's another day in paradise for me.- Don't do it, if that's how you feel.No, I'll do it, I'll do it, just go.Can you bake this stuff? I don't even know, can you bake? Can you? I've never seen you bake anything, I'm sorry.Please? Got some brownies for Deborah.My wife baked them.I'll take them to her.Hey, you know what? We'd like to, bring her If it's all the same to you.I would really like to see the look on her face when I give these to her.It would mean a lot to me.- Me, too.- Just for one minute.Sure.Absolutely.Thank you very much.- Hi, honey.- Hi.You look you know.- Yeah? - I love you.- Hi, Larry.- Look at what "Uncle Larry" brought.- What is that? - A little treat.- Surprise.- Brownies! Brownies.No peanuts.- Thank the Lord.The ones from the other night? Oh My wife got the recipe.Cheryl got the recipe? Oh - Take it.- Oh, jeez.Go ahead, take a little taste.Oh, thank you so much.- Go ahead.Take a bite.- Mmm, huh? Huh, what do you think? You like that? - Hmm - Like a little girl again, huh? You know, they're not quite the same.- No, they're the same.- Um-umm.- Yeah, yeah.- Um-umm.- Yeah, yeah.- Honey, just try another one.Tell Cheryl I said thank you for making the effort, but those are really not the same.What are you talking about? They're delicious, eat it.It's good.It's good, take it.These are definitely not the same brownies.Not the same brownies? It's the same brownie! They're definitely not the same.Believe me, they're the same brownie.My wife baked them.- I know what she baked.- These really suck.I can't believe that she doesn't know the difference between sugar and salt.- How dare you insult my wife's baking! - There's something different - All right.- Fine, fine, you know what? Fine.Save them for later, save it.What do you want me to say, Larry? They're horrible! What time are you picking me up tomorrow night for the Emmys? I feel like nothing's happening, wait.Okay, wait, Larry actually wrote down Oh, my God.He wrote down directions for me, because - we - Hit the red button.- This is pitiful - No, no, Larry! This is so not What? I can't get the satellite to go on.It was working yesterday, just follow the instructions! Just get in here and fix the damn thing! We're missing Joan! We're missing the Emmy Pre-Show with I just This is just so pathetic.You can't wait three hours? lt'll come on regular TV.We want to watch it when the New Yorkers watch it.We need to see the Pre-Show with Joan.We're missing that now.We need to see what everyone's wearing.That's the best part.What was that business I saw you yesterday? - At the coffee shop? - What business? The business with the black guy.You fixed his tip? - What happened? - So? Yeah.What do you mean, "So"? You didn't know? Larry's a tip profiler.- Fixed a black man's tip.- He didn't leave enough.What am I supposed to do? You trying to get a NAACP lmage Award or something? If it wasn't a racial thing, why'd you do it behind his back? I didn't do it behind his back! He tiptoed back into the restaurant.Tippy-toed.- I did not! - You should've seen it.I didn't tiptoe, he stormed out in a huff! I would've done it right in front of his face, but he stormed out.- Well, why'd he storm out? - Because I fired him.You fired him? You fired him?! Why'd you fire the black man? I fired the black man because he's the guy who set up the whole system here and it doesn't work.He's here every week, I'm giving him checks.We've got five remotes, I can't turn it on, but I know, you know, "Black man, he can never do anything wrong, and he shouldn't get fired from a job.Black people always do everything right." You gotta turn the damn satellite on for the TV to work.See the little green light? Just gotta turn it on.Or you can fire the black man.Whatever works for you.Jessica Alba and her fiance Great, thank you.- Thanks, Larry.- Thank you.Who's that? Jane Kaczmarek? Yeah, she's funny.There's Kelsey Grammer and his girlfriend.Thank you, Kelsey.Kelsey Grammer, ladies and gentlemen, one of the greats of our community.Oh, my God, there's Richard! It's Richard Lewis.Richard, over here! Richard, Richard! Come on, it's Joan! Just get over here, it's so good to see you oh, my God.I've seen better faces on a hemorrhoid.When E.T.called home, did you pick up the phone? Excuse me.How are things in Loch Ness?
