- Hey, Larry.- Hey.- How are you? - Okay.Good.Hey, listen, is this true? Did I hear that you were at the U2 concert last night? I got to tell you, man, I been thinking about that - and I can't see you there.- My wife dragged me there.- She had these tickets - Uh-huh.So I did it as a favor to my wife.It's a little embarrassing to me.Don't be embarrassed.You like to rock and roll.How'd you know I was at the U2 concert? Well, you know Marge, at the front.She called to confirm your appointment, your housekeeper told her that you had been there.My housekeeper told Marge I was at the U2 concert? That's what apparently, yeah.Yeah.I didn't know you were into the rock and roll thing.I'm not.You know, I don't like the idea that everything I do people are finding out about through my housekeeper, that's all.Hey, I don't know what else you did yesterday.That's the only thing I know about yesterday.Well, don't mention to anybody that I was at the U2 concert, - if you can.- All right.Let's move past that.What do we got going on here? I have something stuck in my throat.- Let me see.- I got a I got a pubic hair.You got a pubic hair in your throat? - Yeah - All right, hey.Well, let's take a look at it then.That's not that unusual.I got people in here all the time with stuff stuck in their throat.Generally, between you and me, it's not something I do that often You know what? Don't even need to know the schedule.- I know, I'm just - Let's just take Up, open for me.There it is.Yeah, I see it.I see it back there.It's pretty far back, and it's kind of it's kind of wrapped itself around.So I can get it if you want me to.But I'll tell you now, it's gonna be a little painful for you.It's gonna hurt.Frankly, it's gonna hurt.There is the other alternative, which is kind of flush it out.Take some liquids and it will flush out.Three days at the most.Jesus, it's stuck in there and it's scratching me.I just feel like I can get it up but I can't.I know, your choice.Happy to go in and get it if you'd like.Or you can let it come on out by itself.What do you think? - Fine, I'll just wait.- Okay, little advice? - Yeah? - Whatever happened, stay away from that for a couple of days.Don't worry.I'll be staying away from it for a while.Very good.All right, always good to see you.- All right, good to see you.- All right.- Rock on.- All right.- Okay? All right.- Okay, thank you.How did your doctor's appointment go? I got about another two days with this thing.He looked at it and says it will go away by itself.Listen, Larry, we have a lot to do before my parents get here.What? What's there to do? We need to do all their Christmas shopping, and we need to get a Christmas tree.We've got to get Hold it, hold it, hold it.What are you saying? Christmas tree? Yeah, we're gonna pick out a Christmas tree and have it set up.We're getting a Christmas tree? My parents are coming.We're celebrating Christmas.Is that a surprise to you?

Of course we do.It's Christmas.It's too weird, man.Come on, that is just too weird.No, listen, man, you're gonna like it.I'm a Jew.To have a tree in the house, it's bad luck.You know, my guy might not may think I'm switching or something.He might not understand.I think your guy is gonna be fine with it.Don't you want my I'm sorry.Did you tip anybody yet for Christmas? - No, no.- Huh? - You're gonna take care of that? - I'll take care of that.Then I got to go get Jeff, we're gonna go to the club and tip everybody there.There's no end to it with this holiday.But you know what? It's gonna make you feel good.All right, I'll see you later, okay? What should I give ah, you don't know Hey, Dora? Could you do me a favor, okay? When people call and ask for me, could you please just not tell them where I am? - Okay.- Even the doctor's office called up, and you told them I went to a U2 concert, you know? Mm-hmm.I don't like people knowing where I go.- Okay, okay.- Just say I'm not home.- "Not home." - Okay, can you do that? - Not home.- Yeah.- Mr.Larry not home.Okay, okay.- Yes, exactly.Thank you.And here's a little little Christmas thing for you.Oh, okay.- Here you go.- Gracias.- Merry Christmas to you.- Merry Christmas, Mr.Larry, thank you.- All right.- You enjoy.You too.Bye-bye, Mr.Larry.- Oh, Carlos.- Oh, Se�or Larry.How's the gardening? - Oh, it's good.- Gardening's good? - Gardening's good.- It's good gardening, isn't it? - It's good gardening.- Yeah, it's good.- Oh, gardening good, s�.- Yeah.Carlos, I have a little something for you for Christmas.- Feliz navidad.- Gracias.Usted eres muy amable.Very kind.You know what?

Well, yeah, I know the lead singer.- What's his name? - I know his name.- You don't know his name.- Hey, asshole, I know his name.- You don't know his name.- Do you want to bet? - 100 bucks.- Okay, his name's B-o-n-o.You got to pronounce it.I don't know how to pronounce it.I don't know if it's "Sonny Bo-no," or Bon-no.It's Bon-no.But, you know what? Because you spelled it, it's a draw.I don't owe you anything.- Even, okay? - Who told you, by the way? Dora.I called the house and she told me.That is unbelievable.I just spoke to her about that.My doctor knows, now you know.She told the doctor the same thing.Well, you need to talk with your maid.Well, if you come over my house in a couple of days, you'll see a Christmas tree there.Why? Cheryl's parents are coming.She wants a tree.- It's not gonna end there.- I've never had a tree in my life.- It's a little unsettling, you know? - It's unsettling.Nothing worse than Jews with trees.- At least your wife's not Jewish.- My wife's not Jewish, yeah.- But those couples? - Two Jews getting trees? They can't let them have their holiday.We have to horn in on their holiday.- Do we have to get in on it? - It makes me crazy.Yeah.They can't just let them have their holiday.Listen to me, listen to me.Susie's on her way up right now, okay? A couple weeks ago, she went out of town, I made a phone call about 2:00 in the morning, to a friend, woman platonic.Okay? Nothing going on.But she found the phone bill.I told her it was you, okay? I said you got in a fight with Cheryl, you slept over, and then you made the phone call, okay? - Wow, what a wild story.- I don't think it's that bad.- It's good.- It's pretty good.- I do think it's good.- Well, thank you.How come you didn't tell her the truth? Hey, 10 p.m.is the cut-off for platonic friends.After 10 p.m., it gets weird.Hi honey.Oh, Larry, I didn't know you were here.- I forgot you were coming.- How are you, sweetheart? - What a surprise.- Good to see you.- It's so great when you come.- Aw, here's the keys.- Thank you.- So What the   is your problem? What's the matter with him? What are you doing? No, no, I got something stuck in my throat.Have some water.Hey, by the way, do I owe you any money for some of those phone calls that I made last Oh, no.You were in a bad place, it's my pleasure.- I know I ran up a bill.- It's my pleasure.Who are you calling at 2:00 a.m.from my house, Larry? What was that about? I was calling my housekeeper Dora.Wait a minute.You have a fight with Cheryl, you sleep at my house, and at 2:00 a.m.you call your housekeeper? Yeah.She was gonna quit, it was a whole huge thing.She's having big problems with Cheryl.Cheryl can't find anything.She couldn't find her pajamas.She yelled at her.She was gonna quit I had to talk her out of quitting.At 2:00 in the morning, Larry? She was quitting the next day.I had to, yeah.You're lying, or you're lying.One of you two assholes is lying, I just don't know which one.- We're not lying.- Yeah, you are.- No, we're not.- No, we're not.I don't believe you.- It's true.- It's true.Please, I have things to do, okay? All right, let's go to the club and do some tipping.Merry Christmas.A merry Christmas to you, my friend.Thank you for everything.Merry Christmas.Thank you.Very nice.Merry Christmas.- That was great.- How'd you do? Oh, beautiful.It felt good, they're all happy.What's the matter? Did did I tip him? I think I tipped that guy twice.- No.- Yeah.No, that's ridiculous, he would've said something.I'm not sure about that.You know what? I was just going around tipping everybody, And I got - I tipped him twice.- Really? Yeah, 'cause I got confused.Why wouldn't he say something to you? 'Cause he makes twice as much money.What do you mean, why? Well, it's just you know Hi.It's a little awkward, but, you know, I was going around giving out my Christmas Yeah, well, that was very nice.Thank you so much.You're very welcome, but I'm sure you're not aware of this, but I think I inadvertently tipped you twice.Twice? No, no, you came up and you said "Merry Christmas," and you gave me some money, which was very nice, - and then you walked on.- Yeah, and I did that twice.- No, no, you did it once.- Well it was twice.I'm sure you didn't realize it.No, I would have realized it, if it had happened.But since it didn't happen So you're saying I only tipped you once? Yes.Do you want your first tip back? - No, Um-mm.- Okay.I'd like my second tip back.There was no second tip.Hmm.A big gold ball there - Here, yeah - That's perfect.You've got your gold triangle.I'm gonna put this one right in here Larry, hi.- Hi, Larry.- Look, Merry Christmas.You're here.What do you think, you like it? - It's kind of big, isn't it? - Yeah, it's a big one.- Grab a ball.- Just make a hook.I'll show you.- Make a hook.- No, maybe later.It's like, the biggest thing I've ever seen.The bigger the better.Cheryl's in the kitchen, by the way, with Becky.Yeah, they're baking.They're baking cookies.Oh, how wonderful.So did you finish your Christmas shopping yet? No, not quite.Soon.What'd you get Cheryl? You can tell me.You know what? I think I'm gonna give her my grandfather's tallis.- Tallis, what's a tallis? - I don't know that.- It's like a scarf.- Oh, he's getting her a scarf.She loves scarves.Is that all? Yeah.Got something caught in your throat? Grape stem.Oh.Oh, yeah.Well, here, have some That's okay.Oh, this doesn't have a hook.- Hi, Becky.- How are you? - Good.- Happy holidays.- Happy holidays.- How are you? - Okay.- Hello, darling.Honey, why can't you wear the scarf that Dora gave you for your birthday? You know, the red one? Because it itches me.It's itchy.Well, she brought it up to me today.She just feels like you don't care that she gave you this lovely present.Then she told me that you yelled at her for telling people where you go.I didn't yell at her, we had a talk, because my doctor had heard that I went to the U2 concert.You went to the U2 concert? She dragged me to the concert.So I went, what's the big deal? Okay.And listen, she's upset because you tipped Carlos twice as much as you tipped her.What, are you crazy? I didn't do that.- You tipped our gardener twice.- That's really in poor form.- You can't do that.- He's lying, like the waiter.- At the club.- What waiter? I gave the waiter a tip twice, 'cause I didn't remember - Why are you doing that? - I was going around tipping everybody.I didn't know who to tip and who not.I forgot who I tipped, - so I tipped him twice.- You know what you should do? You should take her to lunch at the club.That is a really good idea.Treat her to a very nice lunch.Everything she says you go along with? I would like it if you took me to lunch is all I'm saying.You can disagree with her once.She happens to think that I'm right most of the time.Do you really think I should take her to lunch? Oh, honey, it would mean so much to her.Okay.I'll take her to lunch.I think that's wonderful.- Nice tree, by the way.- Thank you.- Carlos.- Oh, Se�or Larry.Carlos, let me ask you something.Did you tell Dora that you got a bigger Christmas bonus than her? No.'Cause she told my wife that you said that.No, se�or.Why would she make up something like that? No s�.Don't you find that curious? No, se�or.You know what I love? I love how you know when we're gonna run out of soy milk.You anticipate it, and then you put a new one in the refrigerator, so there's always a cold one in there.- I notice that.- Okay, Mr.Larry.You're a good folder.Very good folder.Particularly with the t-shirts.There's a little kind of thing you do at the end you flip them over, the arms, they get, like, flipped over like a little penguin.Okay.I see that, I notice the folding.The toilet paper Okay, let's discuss the toilet paper.I am never in that bathroom looking at cardboard.As soon as it runs out, you've got the new roll.I'm never running out of there with my pants at my ankles screaming, "More toilet paper!" You know? What else, what else do you do? Toilet paper folding soy milk.Your sponge replacement's not so hot if I can speak frankly.Okay, Mr.Larry.- Finished? - No, no.Okay.Se�orita, algo m�s?

The cookies from last night? - Yeah.- What? I ate them.What? You ate them? They were for the manger scene.You ate the baby Jesus and his mother Mary.- I thought they were animal cookies.- Animal cookies? - Are you kidding? - Jesus Christ is not an animal! I thought he was a monkey.- A monkey? - Oh, please! - The Son of God was a monkey? - We worked all day on those cookies.- I'm sorry.- You didn't see the "hay"? The toasted coconut was hay.The barn? I thought that was all part of the zoo.Why would we have a zoo on Christmas Day?! Okay You know what? I'll make it up to you.How are you gonna make it up to us? - You swallowed our Lord and Savior.- I'll make it up.- I'll get another manger scene.- Yeah? Where?

We are humble, simple people.I know you have traveled far.Excuse me.Can I talk to you for a second? - Just continue.- How you doing? Hello.Hi.Let me ask you a question.How can I go about renting one of these manger groups? Renting? We're a volunteer group with the church.- So - I'm kind of in a bind.It's Christmas Day, we have no manger scene.- Is it a manger scene? - A Nativity, certainly.We don't have a Nativity scene in my house.We had one, but I ate it.There were cookies, and is there any way that I could, get your group to go to my house? - Today? - Yes.- Oh, it's Christmas.Wow.- Yeah, I know.Just for a couple of hours.Like, three, four hours.Oh, I see.Well, actually, we do have a break coming up.We could probably see our way to your home.You know, obviously we would work something out.Oh, great, a donation for the church would be a capital thing.- Fine, a donation.- Great, yes.Okay Well, we'd have to maybe discuss the donation.Whatever you think is fair.What do you think is fair? Huh, I don't really want to say, but I guess I'm forced to.$500.And a meal of course, because we're about to have a lunch.I don't really cook.It would have to be take-out, you know.That's fine.Okay, $500, fine.I'll give you $500.And the meal.I don't mean to push.Okay.Which one are you? - I'm "Joseph." - Joseph, Larry.- Hello, Larry.- Hi, nice to meet you.Pleasure.- So yeah, I just - That's "Mary" over there.That would be Mary of course, the Mother of God.Okay, great.You can put all this junk on a trailer? It's not junk, but we do put it in the trailer.It all fits in there.It's very convenient.Beautiful.Well, this is fantastic.- Works out for everybody.- I'm so thrilled about this.I was in a bind, and you really helped me out, Joseph.I'm glad I could do that.It's a pleasure.- We'll need directions to your home.- Yes, of course, yeah.- Find out where we put the manger - Joseph? - Hello, sir.- Hello.Boy, that was fast.Yes, well, the excellent directions didn't hurt.- That always helps, doesn't it? - Yes, it does.Look at that.You packed that manger in five minutes and you're off.Yeah, we all have an assigned job, we pitch in.Too bad you don't have this Christmas all year round, huh? You'd make a pretty good living.Actually we do a Passion Play on Easter.And around 4th of July we do hobo revolutionaries.And sometimes in November we'll do an equinox.Okay.I thought we would set up around here, in this area.Excellent choice.I was thinking the same myself.- Does that work for you? - Yes, sir.Okay, beautiful.- Hi, Mary.- Hi.- Oh, look at the little baby.- Yes.We've all arrived.All right, you got little Jesus and the whole troupe.- All right, very good.- We'll set right up, in short order.- Let me know if you need anything.- Very good, sir, thank you.Okay.A nice man, good host.All right, let's get to it, then.This is fantastic.Look at this.- This is great, I love this.- Thank you.They're gonna be so thrilled when they come home.Thank you, Joseph.Thank you, Mary, shepherds - It's our pleasure.- Joseph, let me ask you something.Yes.You mentioned something about some interest in food a little earlier.We did talk about a meal, yes.You want me to get a take-out thing for you happening? - That's fine.- Chinese, deli? What do you like, Joey? - Yes, yes.- Yes to both? - Yes to both.- You want both? That would be fantastic, thank you.I guess you build a big appetite standing out here doing nothing, huh? - More than you'd think, yes.- Huh, interesting.All right, I'll get you a little orange chicken? - Oh, yeah, sounds wonderful.- Does that sound good? But you got to be careful.They got a lot of hot peppers in there.- Don't eat the peppers.- I like the peppers.- You like the peppers? - I have the tongue for it, yes.- Joseph likes the peppers.- Yes, I do.I confess.All right, very good.Hey, Joseph, let me ask you a question.Are you okay? I got a pubic hair stuck in my throat.Oh that's unfortunate.I can't get rid of this thing.It's killing me.It's driving me nuts, Joseph.Driving me nuts.I'm not interested in your personal Oh, boy.That Mary, by the way, has quite the bod.What? Come on, Joey, between you and me you and Mary? You don't feel like it every now and then? - What do you do? - No.You know what? We're leaving.That's it, let's pack it up.We're leaving! - What? Come on, Joe.- I'm not going to stand for this! Don't "Joe" me, we're leaving.You will take it back.- Get your hands off me! - You stand right here and take it back! - Gentlemen, please! - Take it back! - Kill him, Joseph, kill him! - Shut up, Mary! Get off me! Wait a second.The pubic hair.It's out!
