Gonna come to the meeting tomorrow? - I don't know, I'm thinking about it.- All right.- Ted Danson's doing it.- Really? - Yeah.Michael York.- Is that so?

Great fun, come on.I'll bet that's true.I'll bet that's true.Yeah you know? Hey! Hey, buddy, what's the deal? - What are you talking about? You threw something in my garbage can? - I threw garbage in your garbage can.- That's my garbage can.- So, it's garbage.- I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't.Doesn't garbage belong in a garbage can? My garbage belongs in my garbage can.Your garbage belongs in your garbage can.- Well, what's the difference? - The difference? - It's mine.- The can's not full.I don't get it.Next guy I see throwing garbage in there, I'm gonna kick his ass.I'll give that message to the next guy.- You think I'm kidding? - No, I believe you.- I'm gonna tell the next guy.- Yeah, you do that.- Hi, Barbara.- Hi, nice to see you.Hi.How you doing? - Hi! - Ready to go?

Good.I mean, she's talked about Chet the whole time.- You ask her about the picture frame? - No.How can I? She's been like that all afternoon.I mean, I don't know what to do about this thing.You gave her this picture five months ago.- All she's got to do is get a frame.- All right, I'll ask her.- Her husband's been dead for four months now.I'll bring it up before we go.Okay, I think these are the ones.- Great.Oh, thank you.- Right? - Exactly.- Isn't that nice? Yeah, that's exactly To show you something different.- Boy, I love this shirt.- Isn't that a great picture? That is exactly the kind of shirt that I would wear.Don't you think? - Mm-hmm.- That's great.- Did you take that here? - It was in the back yard.- Doesn't he look healthy, Larry? - Do you know where he got this? - I don't remember.- No idea? I just I don't remember.- I love that picture.- It's nice.Could it have been the mall or the Promenade? No, but I'll Think about it.So, you okay.Thank you for lunch.That was really great.- Was it in Santa Monica? - I don't know.You don't know.Okay, all right.It's just it's such a great-looking shirt.It's Caruso's.Yeah, it was Caruso's.On Wilshire Boulevard! Yes, of course! - Caruso's.Great.- That's a nice picture.- I love it.- All right, well, we're gonna take off.I'm gonna stop off at Caruso's and get that shirt.I wonder if it comes in any other colors.And just wanted to check in about the frame - the picture that you were gonna frame.- Yeah.How's that going? I don't know.'Cause it's kind of been like five months, you know? And we were just wondering.My husband dropped dead.- Yeah, that was four months ago.- Okay.You know, there was just some details - that I had to take care of, right? - You know what God forbid it should ever happen to you, Cheryl.I don't think you would be thinking about She'd be dancing around the Trevi Fountain in Rome - that's just a joke.- I'm sorry.I'm just not ready to have a sense of humor about this, you know? - I understand.- I'm sorry.You take care.- Thanks for the lunch and the catalogs.- Yeah.- What's the name of this place anyway? - Bobo's.Bobo's? I like that.- Ted.- Jeff, hey.Are you in on this too? Are you in on this too? What are you doing, throwing your money away? - Why not? - Really? You ever done anything like this? I once invested in a whorehouse.- I made a fortune on that place.- How are you? I'm great, man, I'm great.- How's Mary doing? - She's good.She's in Australia shooting that film still.Which is too bad, because she's going crazy.She's missing Jill's birthday which reminds me, a week from Sunday, - the birthday party for Jill.- I'm all over it.- You're coming? - All set.Here's the embarrassing part: we promised her a "Wizard of Oz" kind of party thing.So, I'm going to do the Scarecrow.If I got you the costume, would you do, - I don't know, one of them, the Lion? - Lion? Sure.Him? I do an unbelievable Lion.Well, I got to do the Lion, though, seriously.Let me do the Lion.You will not regret it.- A fat Tin Man? - I can't do I won't come if I have to do the Tin Man.- Let him do it.- You can be the Lion.I'll be the fat Tin Man that'll disappoint children.- What are you gonna do for Dorothy? - What about Cheryl? - Would she come? - Cheryl could do Dorothy.- She would love to.- Great.Thank you.I'll get the costumes and everything this is really nice.- You like this? - Great taste.Where'd you get it? I got it actually I saw a dead guy's picture.Everybody, Larry David.Hey, Michael York, how you doing? - Glad to meet you.- Michael's here to class up our act.- Lou DiMaggio.- How are you doing? Nice to meet you, Larry.Pleasure to meet you.I'll be managing the restaurant.Jim Swenson.- Hi, Jim.You were the manager of Gus'.- Yes, I was.- Theresa Nakamura.- Hello.Hi, Theresa.I was at Gus', too.Let's sit, let's sit.I don't know if I'm gonna come in on this.It sounds intriguing, I have to say.We have a very exciting place here.The location is perfect.And we got great ideas for a new restaurant.It's going to be a hit.Well, I know one thing, I will not be giving you people any money if you serve kabobs.- You're kidding, right? - No, I'm not kidding.- I don't think have kabobs.- Why are you a kabobaphobe? - I can't stand kabobs.- "Kabobaphobe"? Have you had a bad experience with kabobs? What happened? Just when you're putting them off the stick I'm a little afraid of the stick, frankly.No kabobs! How about this idea? I feel that you can never get a waiter's attention.So, I'm suggesting that every table should have a bell on it.And so, when you want the waiter, you just ring a bell What if three or four people are ringing the thing at once? How does their waiter know Every waiter could have their own tone.So you can identify when the waiter hears "ding, ding, ding," they know it's him.And if then if it's "ding, ding, ding," a lower tone - A bell? - They would answer to a bell like a Pavlovian dog? - It's like a butler bell.- Exactly! I'm surprised you're not on board with that.It's English.It's a butler bell.- Michael York, what do you think? - I'm so appalled by the idea - that I'm struck dumb.- It's a good idea.Think about it.What else do you have? What are you doing for the waiters' uniforms? We have a very tasteful white shirt, dark slacks, and name tags.- No good, huh? - I think we can do better than that.- Larry, what do you envision? - I don't know, I think I'll go shopping for uniforms.- You'll come with me.- I'm with you to keep an eye on things.All right, so give us a choice.I'll come back with something you'll be very happy with.Is everybody good with that? I'm good with that.So, you're in.Welcome aboard.Maybe.So, we're definitely doing this? It's right on Ocean.It's in a great location, they've got a great chef They couldn't find somebody else to invest? There are tons of people with money.Maybe they could, but I'm lucky I was asked.We should look at it like a good thing.- We can make a lot of money from this.- Oh, I hope so.- But that's not even the point.- What is the point? We could hang out there.People would come in and I'll walk around and go to a table - "Are you enjoying your meal?" - You're going to walk around? This is why you want to do this, so you can chat with people? "How's everything? Are you enjoying it?" I thought you didn't like talking to people.I don't like talking to people I know, but strangers I have no problem with.I think it'll be fun.I was put in charge of uniforms.This is something that I'm very interested in.I always wondered, "How do they choose the uniforms?" Well, I'm going to choose the uniforms.I'm going shopping with Jeff to pick out uniforms for the waiters.That's why you want to do this so you can pick out uniforms for It's not only uniforms, you're making other decisions.I asked about we're gonna get sweet potatoes on the menu.'Cause you can't get sweet potatoes anywhere.Have you noticed that? Everybody's noticed that.I have this great idea about bells for the table, 'cause you can never summon waiters.They never come when you want them.Did you bring this up at the meeting? How did that go over? - I think it went okay.- They liked that idea? - I think they did.- People ringing bells - all over the restaurant? - Yeah.Is that a new shirt? Yeah, this is the shirt - that Chet was wearing in the picture.- At Barbara's house? I went to Caruso's and got it.They had three left.Really? You went shopping? I did.I love the shirt.Ted Danson liked it too.I'm getting a lot of compliments on it.- It looks good.- Feel this material.This is beautiful.So, Barbara said she'd have that frame ready next week.- Oh, good, see? - See? It paid for me to open my mouth.And your dentist called and wants us over for dinner Saturday.- Dr.Blore? - Yeah.- Wants to have us for dinner? - Yeah.I thought that you'd know what that meant.He's my dentist.Why is he calling me for dinner? I don't know.Well, what are we gonna talk about, my teeth? I didn't know what to say.I thought you guys talked about it.I've never mentioned anything to him about getting together.I wouldn't mix social and professional.That's a terrible combination.Well, I'm just gonna tell him we're going out of town or something.- Okay.- Because if we go over to his house for dinner, we'll have to invite him someplace.If we don't, then he's gonna be offended.Then the next time I go there, there's gonna be tension "I invited you, why didn't you invite me?" You know what I mean? - We don't want to get into that game.- Um-mmm.I'll need a new dentist soon, there's no question about it.That's the end of this dentist for all intents and purposes.I'm telling you, it's already ruined.The whole thing ah, everybody's got to get together."Got to get together." The whole world's got to get together.Hey.How about this? That's what you want the waiters to wear? Yeah, why not? So you want the waiters to dress like you? Why is that bad? Oh, man, you're out of control.No, they should walk around looking like you.- I didn't say that.- Well? What about this? - Hey, what about this? - Come on.- It looks like a tablecloth, right? - Yeah.- Yeah.- Yeah? So, the waiters' shirts match the tablecloth.- And? - What do you mean, "and"? That's interesting.- Interesting? - Yeah! I'm not finding anything.We got to get out of here.There's nothing here.I'm gonna get remember that shirt I was wearing that Ted Danson liked? - That cream shirt? - With the black? - I think I'll get that for him.- That's nice.- I got it here.- That's very nice.I might even get another one for me.- Why? - 'Cause I always ruin my shirts.I stain them and I'd like it would be good to have an extra one.Is it crazy to have two of the same shirt? No, it's fine.You get a stain on it, you got another one.- Excuse me.- Yes, sir? I don't know if you remember.I was in a couple days ago, I bought a two-tone shirt.You had three in the basement.Yeah, the cream and black.- I want to get the other two.- Just give me one second.- Check that out.- Man, she is hot.Look at that shirt.Is that a beauty, the epaulets? - Look at the epaulets.- It's a military shirt.Yes, exactly, it's a military shirt.I don't know where you're going with this.- Have you ever been to the mess hall? - No, I never have.Have you ever seen well-dressed soldiers eating? - No, I've never been in the military.- You should eat there.- Have you eaten in a mess hall? - Yes, I have.- Really? - I never ate in an officers' mess hall, But I can imagine they're all there in their brilliant uniforms.- When were you in the military? - Years ago, but that has nothing to do with anything.Excuse me.I don't normally do this, but I know you from somewhere and I just can't place it.Burt Bondy.I think I know you from the 12:15 spin class at the gym.Burt? No, I've never taken a spin class, sorry.- Oh, I'm sorry.- Okay.Are you "a friend of Bill W.'s"? In the program? AA? I think I know you from there, don't I? No, I wish you did.it sounds like a nice place to hang out.Where do I know? What is your name? - Larry David.- Larry David, Burt Bondy.I know you from the waiting room at the dentist's office.Dr.Blore.We have the same dentist.Oh, okay, okay, yeah, yeah, right.Burt Bondy.- I don't actually go to him anymore.- I still see him.I run into him, - I'll tell him you said hello.- You don't have to.You don't want me to say hello? It's kind of a trite thing to say to somebody anyway - "Someone says hello" - I hear what you're saying.Very high level.I got to get there.- That's good.- Yeah.- Okay, it was nice meeting you.- Okay, Burt, take care.Burt Bondy? What was that all about? My dentist invited me out to dinner.I'm supposed to be going tonight, and I told him I was out of town.Sir? - Last two.- Great.It's kind of got a little French quality to it, no? Yeah, French Foreign Legion, maybe, but, no.They might think we have Scientologists for wait people.Are you kidding me? You don't like this? Is that what you're saying? I look at that and I see we're serving airline food.- I'm sorry.- Can I show mine? All right.Simple, simple, simple.This is the shirt crisp, clean, beautiful.Now, here's where it all comes together.Ladies and gentlemen, I present the vest.A vest, a vest, a navy vest.Simple, lovely.It feels good.- It's a vest! - Upscale.It's very classy, right? It's along the lines of what we're talking about.Actual applause, mind you.- That's my favorite.- You really like that? - Classic.- I like it.I got you a present.Oh, look at that.That's the shirt you wore the other day.That's nice.That's great.Thanks, Lar, that's really sweet of you.- Oh, gee, look at that.- A little rip there.My God, I'm sorry.Well, just take it back.I'm sure they'll fix it for you.Uh couldn't you take it back? I don't even know where this store is.It's on Wilshire and Eighth.I don't understand.You want me to take it back? I just gave you a gift.You gave me a defective shirt.It's got a hole in it.That's not a gift.I don't own this shirt anymore, as I see it.I gave it to you.- It's your responsibility.- It's not the point.The point is, if you give somebody a gift, it's supposed to be a gift, not a problem.And if you give somebody a gift, they're not supposed to be an ingrate.All right, how about I give you a gift, and you have to pick it up in Seattle? That's a problem, not a gift.- It's not quite the same thing.I'm giving you a gift.It is the same thing.I appreciate the gesture.Thank you.Fine, I'll keep the shirt.- Great.- I can use an extra shirt.- You took a nice thought, and all of a sudden it's like- - You took a nice thought - I'm sorry.So we're going with the blue shirt and the vest? Thank you, everybody, I appreciate that.It just seems like you're taunting Ted.- I'm not taunting him.- Taunting him When I buy a new shirt, I like to wear it a lot, so what? - I didn't think about him when I put it on.- Okay.Hi! - Hey.Hi, Jill, happy birthday! Hi, Larry.- Hi, Ted.Good to see you.- Thanks for coming.I like your tiara, that's nice.Fifth birthday, this is very cool.So let's get going.Where's my Lion costume?

There's got to be a reason.Larry, it's a party.Let's lighten up, come on.- You'll be fine.- Is it 'cause of the shirt? 'Cause I wore the shirt? Because of the shirt? No, don't be silly, Larry.- Help me out here.- It's a party.Let's have a good time.If I can't do the Lion, I won't do the Tin Man.- I don't like the Tin Man.- Well, all right, We'll find someone else.I'll be right back, sweetheart, - I'm gonna get that other gift.- Yeah, find somebody else.What an A-S-S-H-O-L-E.- Okay.- Hey!

I'm the Lion! I don't have to do the voice.He's doing a great job.Did you see us come down the Yellow Brick Road? - We're having fun, all right? - Oof! - Larry! - Oh-hh! - Oh, oh, Larry, I'm so sorry.- Oh, my God! She broke my teeth! She didn't mean to, Larry.All right, let's get some ice.- Oh, my shirt! - Oh my God! My shirt! - We've got to get you to a dentist.- A dentist? It's Sunday.- They're not open on Sunday.- We'll have to call Dr.Blore.Dr.Blore? Burt Bondy.Ah-hh! You know what? Maybe I need a little more novocaine.No, it's gonna kick in.It's fine, yeah.Still a little something? - It's getting there? - A little bit.It's getting there.I feel it getting numb.Good, I'll give it a minute.Anyway, thanks for doing this.I know dentists don't like to come in on Sundays.It's like a sacred day.Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, you know? - But I appreciate it.- Not a problem.Happy to do it.Sure missed you last Saturday.Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm so sorry.- How did it turn out? - Oh, it was nice, but, you know It would've been great.I'm so sorry I couldn't make it.- Have a good trip? - Yeah, we went up to Sonoma.My cousin's got a pear farm up there.A pear farm? Like an orchard, right? Bartlett pears.Bartlett, those are I like pears.They're delicious, but all weekend long, pear after pear.- Pears in everything, sure.- Boy, oh, boy, I was getting the runs up there after a while.Well, fruit will do that.I'd much rather have been in your house on Saturday night than eating pears.And it's relatives.What are you gonna do? - Right, right.- And we visited the cabin where Bob Bartlett who the pear's named after? - The guy named Bob Bartlett.- I didn't realize the pear was named - In the early part of the 20th century.- Here in the Yeah, right here up in Sonoma Bob Bartlett.And we went to his saw his cabin and everything.And he's still got relatives there.Yeah, and they're still making a living off of these pears for over 100 years now.Everybody knows a Bartlett pear, right? The Bartletts are they run the town there.- That's that a green pear, right? - No, it's a brown pear.They start off green, then they turn brown.I thought that was the Bosc that was the brown.No, no.It's the Bartlett.Burt Bondy was in this week.Burt Bondy? Do I know him? I don't know.- He seems to think you do.- Really? Mm-hmm.- Burt Bondy.- I don't think so.I think we're ready.Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on - Honey? - Yeah.How did it go? Look at that.These are supposed to be temporaries, okay? See the size of these things? He did it on purpose Blore.Because Bondy obviously told him that he ran into me and I wasn't out of town, And he did this to get even.- They're only temporaries.- I know they're only temporaries, but temporaries aren't supposed to look like Ch/c/ets/ - Look at the size of these things.- That's about right.- You don't know - I know what I'm talking about.- You don't know about temporaries.- How do you know? I can imagine that you know very little about temporaries.I don't want to have a conversation with you about temporaries.- That's what they look like.- Like I want to talk about temporaries? Did you see what's on? - Zeke, you're just as scared as I am.- Oh, wonderful.If you just would've done the Tin Man, none of this would've happened.Maybe Jill did it on purpose too.That's a possibility.Maybe you shouldn't have called Ted an asshole.Look at this shirt.Look at this.Fortunately I have two more upstairs The one I bought for Ted, and I bought an extra one, see? You know, it's not funny, Cheryl.- I got hit in the mouth with a bat! - I'm sorry, I honestly am concerned about that.- Who the hell is that? - That's Barbara with the frame.Hey, I'm so sorry.Can I come in? - Yeah? - Yeah.I am so sorry.That's an awful thing to happen.- How you doing? - Great.Let me see.- Wow, they're big, aren't they? - Yeah, they're very big.- They hurt? - No.I'm so sorry.You know what? Can I just give you a word of advice? - Yes, absolutely.- Forget the piata parties, okay? It's a dangerous game.You could see what could happen you got kids swinging baseball bats around.And even if the candy comes down, then you've got vultures coming and getting candy, stuffing it in their pocket, killing each other to get to the candy.It's a crazy game, it's dangerous.I don't know how the Spaniards do it.How long have they been doing this pi�ata? Not one Spanish person has figured out that the pi�ata is a sick ing game? I hope you know Jill did not do that on purpose.Really, she feels terrible about it.You shouldn't have called me an asshole in front of her, but - She's a pretty good speller.- Yeah.Five years old, she can spell "asshole." That's pretty good.Hey, you know what? On the way up here, I was thinking, I would like that shirt.I'll take it and I'll exchange it.It was a great gift.You can't exchange anymore.They're out.- There's no more left.- It doesn't matter.I can take it to a shirt guy, he'll fix it.This one's ruined, as you can see, and I was kind of planning on keeping the other one.The one you gave me? The one you gave back to me.I only gave it back to you because you were being rude about me having to exchange it.You still nevertheless didn't accept my gracious gift, - and you gave it back to me.- Why are you doing this? Every time we get together, we push and pull like this.You should have kept the shirt in the first place Larry, Larry! I'm trying to watch "The Wizard of Oz." You just said you have two shirts upstairs.Go upstairs, give Ted his shirt, and you'll have one for yourself.Hi, Ted.You got two sh/rts? Well, I bought an extra one.Somewhere over the rainbow Hey.Just put it down.There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow Oh.that's Barbara.So, the restaurant you in? Yeah, I'm going in for the same amount as you.Yeah? - Yeah, you got a problem? - No, no.- Is that all right? Yeah? - Yeah.- Okay.- All right, that looks great.- I thought it came out really well.- It really did.I'm sorry it took such a long time.- It's just, with Chet you understand.- I know, I know.Yeah, that looks good.Oh, we're watching "The Wizard of Oz." You want to come back? Come on.Oh, why can't I? Come on in, have a seat.Barbara, do you know Ted? Hi.Oh, my God, oh This was our movie.Chet loved this song.If happy little bluebirds fly Beyond the rainbow Chet's shirt! No, no! Hey, asshole!
