A beautiful Sunday, we're sitting here like idiots.
We should be playing golf.
Yeah.
How do you work a glue gun? Oh, yeah, like I know how to work a glue gun.
Should we try going to a public course? On a Sunday it'd be a long wait.
When do you think I'm gonna hear from the new club? - Thursday.
- My interview went very well.
I thought mine went great too.
- It did? - Yeah! - Did you have the tall blond guy? - Two guys.
- I think they took a shine to me.
- Took a shine to you? - I really do.
- Okay.
I don't know what to do without golf.
When I'm done with this paper, - I'm gonna wander the streets.
- Wow.
You wanna get the violin out? - Get the violin out.
- That's pretty sad, yeah.
Another thing, I'd love to get to this Dodger game tomorrow night.
- I called everybody I know.
- You did? - Yep.
Nothing.
- Nothing? Everybody at Dodger Stadium, from top to bottom, nobody's got tickets.
It's gonna be some game.
I know.
I wanna go too.
It's too bad we got kicked out of that golf club.
Marty Funkhouser has two season tickets to the Dodgers.
His father just died.
He's probably not even going.
He hasn't even gone back to work yet.
So he's not gonna go to the game.
So what's gonna happen to those tickets? They'll go to waste.
It is weird to ask a guy, you know his father just died, - can we use your tickets? - It is kind of tacky to do that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Huh.
Still, I mean it doesn't hurt to ask.
It might be a way to What do you do, just call him up and say, "Hey?" "Marty, I know you're still in mourning" Right.
I'm sure you're still in "Marty, I know you're still in mourning, but is there any" "I feel your grief, but are you gonna use those tickets?" "Marty, just so your tickets don't go to waste.
" There's no good way to go about it, none.
Still You know every Sunday he has brunch over at Nat's.
Well, we gotta get some breakfast anyway, right? We just say hello, we happen to run into him.
Let's get breakfast.
Maybe we'll run into him, say hello.
We'll feel it out, check him out.
Zip in, zip out, say hello.
If the subject of baseball comes up, it comes up, that's all.
Ah, see him? See him? Yeah.
Yeah, it's tougher than I thought, but hopefully - in a few weeks, I'll feel better.
- Look at this! - Hey, hey.
- Look-a here.
Look what's going on here.
Do me a favor, call me back and we'll play maybe.

It's a shame about your dad and all because, well, you're probably just not up for going to the game, I guess, huh? No, I decided I'm gonna go.
- No kidding? - Good for you.
He would have wanted me to go.
- I think that's true.
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't you? - He would have, most certainly.
Hey, if you're a little lonely, you need a little companionship at the game, if you want me to keep you company, I'd be happy to do it.
I don't have a seat for you.
- What about your dad's seat? - It's spoken for.
- Okay, all right.

We used to go to games together.
It makes me feel close to him.
It's to honor him.
Oh, no! Home run, yeah! - Come on, Marty, let me sit there.
