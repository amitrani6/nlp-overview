photographer: the most exquisite hands you\\'ve ever seen.. oh, he had it all. george:  what happened to him?  man:  tragic story, i\\'m afraid. he could\\'ve had any woman in the world.. but none could match the beauty of his own hand.. and that became his one true love..  george: you mean, uh..? man: yes. he was not.. master of his domain. george:  but how.. uh..? man:  the muscles.. became so strained with.. overuse, that eventually the hand locked into a deformed position, and he was left with nothing but a claw.  he traveled the world seeking a cure.. acupuncturists.. herbalists.. swamis.. nothing helped. towards the end, his hands became so frozen the was unable to manipulate utensils,  and was dependent on cub scouts to feed him. i hadn\\'t seen another pair of hands like ray mckigney\\'s.. until today. you are his successor.  i.. only hope you have a little more self-control. george:  you don\\'t have to worry about me.  i won a contest.  photographer: ok, let\\'s get to work.    bryant:  back now, 7:46. on tuesday the 19th here in new york there will be a benefit for the goodwill industries - a used clothing organization that provides service to the needy. one of the performers will be comedian jerry seinfeld.  jerry, good morning. jerry:  thank you, bryant. bryant:  and speaking of clothing , that is a very, very unusual shirt you have on. jerry:  oh, thank you.  bryant: you\\'re all kinda,  all kinda \"puffed up\".  jerry: yeah, it\\'s a puffy shirt.
